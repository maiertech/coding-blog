# coding-blog

This is the repository for the launch of my blog [Coding for the Web](https://www.codingfortheweb.blog). This project started a s a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) project, then temporarily turned into a [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) project and now finally I have settled on [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) as my preferred static site generator.

This blog uses [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and the template will slowly evolve from there.
