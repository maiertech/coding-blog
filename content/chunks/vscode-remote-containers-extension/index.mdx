## Extension identifier

[ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Purpose

This extension adds a `Containers` option to VS Code's remote explorer. You can
then open a folder with a container configration inside that container or clone
an entire repository inside a container defined by that repository. This makes
it easy to develop on your computer without having to configure a development
environment.

## Dependencies

You need to pair this extension with
[VS Code Docker extension](/chunks/vs-code-remote-containers-extension/) to
ensure that it can create and spin up Docker containers.

## Settings

Since this extension makes sense only when its dependencies are installed, you
should add it to

```json
{
  "settingsSync.ignoredExtensions": ["ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"]
}
```

Then it won't get automatically synchronized into all your projects.
