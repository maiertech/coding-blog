üç™ create-next-app is a great way to get started with
[@vercel](https://twitter.com/vercel)'s Next.js. Install default template with

npx create-next-app

or any example from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples by
adding -e followed by example's directory name, e.g.

npx create-next-app -e blog

Also works with Yarn.
