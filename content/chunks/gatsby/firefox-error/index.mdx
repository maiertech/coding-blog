üç™ If you see an "Unhandled Runtime Error" in
[@firefox](https://twitter.com/firefox) while developing with
[@gatsbyjs](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs), this happens when privacy friendly
setting

"Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"

is checked. Add an exception for localhost:8000 to allow it to use cookies and
site data.
