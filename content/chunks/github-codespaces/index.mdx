To help understand how GitHub Codespaces works under the hood.

- GitHub Codespaces is just running Docker
- The repository to keep an eye on is this one:
  https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers.
- The containers folder contains actual image definitions:
  https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers.
- The scripts-library folder contains scripts that are pulled in to build
  containers.
- Scripts are documented here:
  https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/script-library/docs
- Example: How to add GitHub CLI to a container how to mix library scripts
