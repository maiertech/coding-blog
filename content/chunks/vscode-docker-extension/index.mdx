## Extension identifier

[ms-azuretools.vscode-docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)

## Purpose

Managing Docker containers for remote development on local Docker containers.
Check out my post
[Introduction to GitHub Codespaces](/posts/introduction-to-github-codespaces/)
for an intro on how to develop with containers (both in the cloud and locally).

## Dependencies

You need to install
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop):

```bash
brew install docker
```

Docker Desktop is a resource-itensive application and you should only run it if
you have a beefy computer. For local development with containers you need to
pair this extension with
[VS Code Remote - Containers extension](/chunks/vs-code-remote-containers-extension/).

## Settings

Since this extension makes sense only when Docker Desktop is installed, you
should add it to

```json
{
  "settingsSync.ignoredExtensions": ["ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"]
}
```

Then it won't get automatically synchronized into all your projects.
