üç™ When using containers with [@code](https://twitter.com/code), you can
hard-wire workspace extensions in `devcontainer.json` under `extensions`.

Corresponding extension settings go in `.vscode/settings.json`, not
`devcontainer.json`, to make them available for both local and container
development.
