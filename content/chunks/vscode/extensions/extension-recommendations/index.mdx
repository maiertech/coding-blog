üç™ Workspace extensions in [@code](https://twitter.com/code) are specific to a
workspace. You cannot enforce workspace extensions, only make recommendations.

Extension recommendations go in

`.vscode/extensions.json`

under `recommendations`. From there VS Code picks them up and suggests them to
users.
