  I recently upgraded husky from v4 to v5. It turned out that this was more
  complicated than I expected. In this chunk I explain how to migrate a simple
  v4 config to v5.

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is an NPM package which needs to be
installed as part of `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. It installs Git
hooks that can be executed when certain Git commands run. The most common use
case for Git Hooks is a pre-commit hook which runs prior to a `git commit`. I
use a pre-commit hook to run
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to lint all files that are
part of a commit.

In husky v4 my hooks were configured in a `.huskyrc`:

```json
// .huskyrc
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
    "pre-push": "yarn lint && yarn test"
  }
}
```

Husky v4 took care of installing hooks automatically. The
[v4-to-v5 migration guide](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=migrate-from-v4-to-v5)
explains that in v5 instead of maintaining a config file you maintain hook files
directly.

Before creating any hook files, you need to manually wire up husky in your
`.git` folder:

```bash
npx husky install
```

This creates `.husky` folder with a `.gitignore` inside. Next you create an
empty pre-commit hook with this command:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit
```

Then add the pre-commit commands from your v4 config file. Since hooks run
outside of Yarn, you need to type `yarn lint-staged` instead of `lint-staged`.
This is what the generated and modified pre-commit hook looks like:

```bash
// .husky/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

yarn lint-staged
```

Now create an empty pre-push hook with this command

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-push
```

and add the pre-push commands from the v4 config file. The pre-push hook now
looks like this:

```bash
// .husky/pre-push
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

yarn lint
yarn test
```

You can try committing a file with a lint error, which should fail. To test the
pre-push hook, you can commit a file with a lint error with using `--no-verify`
option with `git commit` and then try pushing the branch, which should fail.

Note that you should not create Git hooks manually since they need execute
permissions to run. `husky add` makes sure that permissions are correct. But if
someone else clones the repository after you committed all of above config
files, hooks will not be installed automatically inside the cloned repo.

In a private repo, including monorepos, you can add the following script to
ensure that hooks are installed automatically when `yarn install` runs:

```json
// package.json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "husky install"
  }
}
```

And finally, there is no point installing hooks in CI. Set variable `HUSKY` to
`0` in CI to suppress hooks.
