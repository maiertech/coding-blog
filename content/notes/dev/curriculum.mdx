Useful links to learning resources for my coding career. The curriculum I would
take if I had to do it all over again.

A few years ago I would have listed a number of books to read. Books were the
main learning tool for my academic training. But I never had the stamina to
crunch through an entire text book. Only later when online training was more
common, I discovered that interactive formats that slice a curriculum in easier
to digest chunks suit me much better.

Therefore, this curriculum features online courses that helped me learn a topic
from scratch within a short amount of time.

You can do a lot of heavy lifting with CSS, even if you opt for CSS-in-JS.
Mastering Flexbox and CSS Grid is crucial for layouts and component libraries
alike.

## Regular Expressions

I treated regular expressions like a step child and every time I needed one, I
wasted tons of time figuring out from scratch how to assemble a regular
expression.
