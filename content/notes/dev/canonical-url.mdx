- In my SEO component I set the canonical URL by default to location.pathname.
  The original idea was to protect myself from duplicate content penalties
  should a deploy preview get indexed by Google accidentally.

  indexed. I still need to read up on these.
- Canonical URL can interfere with Fathom Analytics. When I used Twitter URLs as
  canonical URLs temporarily for chunks, it would index them under the path of
  the Twitter URL, which is not what you want. You can fix this with a setting:
