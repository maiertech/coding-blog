  an option.
- Bundles dependencies only.

## Parcel

[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is probably the easiest to use bundler. It has
good docs and is also suitable for simple web projects. If you want to invest
into a bundler but not learn Webpack rocket science, this is probably the
bundler to learn.
