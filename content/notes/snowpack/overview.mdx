- UNPKG was a way to make UMD builds of NPM packages accessible on a CDN
- This allowed building React apps without a bundler.
- Alternatively, you could partially bundle and improve performance by caching
  certain packages like React.
- But there are still many packages that are CJS only.
- Snowpack leverages ESM.
- When you install a dependecy Snowpack precompiles it and makes it ready for
  ESM.
- Then you can just build your stuff without a bundler. This is a little bit
  like create-react-app without a bundler.
- But you want something like Gatsby or Next.js.
- Chris Biscardi's Toast is one answer to this. It supports MDX.
