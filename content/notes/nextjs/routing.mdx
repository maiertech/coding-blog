## `pages`

Next.js uses file-system based routing inside the `pages` directory. Pages map
to routes as you would expect.

You can also create a page for a dynamic route, e.g. `pages/posts/[id].js`:

- It needs to export async function `getStaticPaths`, which needs to return
  possible values for `id`.
- It also needs to export `getStaticProps({ params })` to fetch data for each
  route to be generated.

## `public`

Static assets go into directory `public`.
