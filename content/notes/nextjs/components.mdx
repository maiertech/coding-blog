## next/link

`Link` is a wrapper around `<a>` for client-side navigation. The `href`
attribute goes with `Link` and not with `<a>`. This is not very intuitive. For
external links use `<a>` only.

## next/image

Gatsby was the first framework to introduce automatic image processing for fixed
and fluid images,
[see my note on image processing for Gatsby](/notes/gatsby/images/). Processing
images during a build increases buidl duration. I describe mitigations in my
note.

next/image takes a different approach. When hosted on Vercel, the `Image`
component supports image processing on the edge network. It will then serve an
optimized image. This is done on demand and not not during the build process.
The `Image` component abstracts away the complexity of an API like Cloudinary or
ImgIX. You can keep your images in a GitHub repository without getting penalized
during the build. This is a superior approach, but it is tightly coupled to
hosting on Vercel.

## next/head

This is next.js's version of react-helmet.
