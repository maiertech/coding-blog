## Pre-rendering (whenever SEO counts)

- Static generation: generate HTML at build time.
  - without data: just as you would expect.
  - with data: export `getStaticProps` to retrieve external data.
- Server-side rendering: generate HTML on each request.
  - without data: makes no sense, not available.
  - with data: export `getServerSideProps(context)` to retrieve external data
    with context containing request specific parameters.

You can choose per page which method to use.

## Client-side rendering

Alternative to server-side rendering. Statically generate whatever you can and
then fetch data on the client. The recommended way of doing this is
[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/).
