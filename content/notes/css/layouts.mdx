## The `100vh` challenge

When using `min-height: 100vh;`, on iOS Safari you do not get the expected
result since the viewport is bigger than the visible area due to Safari showing
its address bar. The common solution that you will find when googling is this
trick:

```
min-height: 100vh;
min-height: fill-available;
```

`fill-available` will then be auto-prefixed to `-webkit-fill-available` and
`-moz-available`. Usually this is done on `body`. The only problem: it does not
universally work.

First, in a CSS-in-JS library, such as Theme UI, you cannot repeat CSS
properties. The idea is that repeating CSS properties should only be done by the
auto-prefixer, while you write clean CSS. Second, Chrome recognizes
`-webkit-fill-available`, but it does not result in the desired effect when
there are `html`, `body` or any `div`s further up the tree whose height is
defined by their content. If you fix this by assigning a `height` of `100%` to
all of them, it works in Chrome but not in Firefox where `-moz-available` does
not do what it is supposed to do.

That's why the best thing to do is to set `height` to 100% on your flexbox it on
every `div`, `body` and `html`. Then you can make your sticky footer work with
Flexbox and make it look as expected on mobile Safari.
