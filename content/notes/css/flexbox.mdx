The free course [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) is the
best learning resource for Flexbox I came across. As an alternative you can take
[What the Flexbox?!](https://flexbox.io/).

Use `display: flex;` on a div to switch to flexbox layout. Everyting inside the
div is referred to as flex items.

## flex-direction

Determine the main axis and direction by setting `flex-direction` to

| Value            | Default |
| :--------------- | :------ |
| `row`            | ✓       |
| `row-reverse`    |         |
| `column`         |         |
| `column-reverse` |         |

Flex items are placed along the main axis.

## justify-content

`justify-content` determines how flex items are placed along the main axis. You
can set it to

| Value           | Default | Description                   |
| :-------------- | :------ | :---------------------------- |
| `flex-start`    | ✓       |                               |
| `center`        |         |                               |
| `flex-end`      |         |                               |
| `space-between` |         |                               |
| `space-around`  |         | Equal space around each item. |

`justify-content` is moot if you have at least one item with `flex-grow` which
takes up all additional available space.

## align-items

Use `algin-items` to align all flex items along the cross axis. You can set it
to

| Value        | Default |
| :----------- | :------ |
| `stretch`    | ✓       |
| `flex-start` |         |
| `center`     |         |
| `flex-end`   |         |

Aligment follows reading direction, i.e. left to right and top to bottom.

## align-self

Use `align-self` to define exceptions from `align-items` for individual flex
items.

## flex-grow

`flex-grow` is a positive number that defines how flex items grow along main
axis. The default is `0`. It represents a ratio in comparison to other flex
items that grow. The ratio defines how additional pixels along the main axis are
allocated to each growing flex-item.

The moment one flex item has a `flex-grow` with a positive number defined,
`justify-content` is moot.

## flex-shrink

`flex-shrink` is a positive number that defines how flex items shrink along the
main axis when there is not enough space. The default is `1`, i.e., flex items
shrink by default. To prevent a flex-item from shrinking, set it to `0`. It also
represents a ratio by which space that is lost is allocated to shrinking flex
items.

The moment `flex-shrink` kicks in, `justify-content` is moot.

## flex-basis

`flex-basis` is an ideal hypthetical size along the main axis before any growing
or shrinking kicks in:

| `flex-direction` | `flex-basis` overrides | Min `flex-basis` | Max `flex-basis` |
| :--------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| `row`            | `width`                | `min-width`      | `max-width`      |
| `row-reverse`    | `width`                | `min-width`      | `max-width`      |
| `column`         | `height`               | `min-height`     | `max-height`     |
| `column-reverse` | `height`               | `min-height`     | `max-height`     |

The default value for `flex-basis` is `auto` which means that a flex item honors
`width` (for `flex-direction` `row` or `row-reverse`) or `height` (for
`flex-direction` `column` or `column-reverse`). If no width or height are
defined, a flex item renders with its intrinsic size.

Setting `flex-basis` to `0` is like setting `width` to `0`. It forces a flex
item to its smallest size possible (not its intrinsic size).

## order

`order` defines an order along the main axis. `order` is a weight rather than an
absolue position, similar to `z-index`. The default is `0`.

The higher `order` the farther away a flex item is placed along the
`flex-direction`. `order` can also be negative. Flex items are ordered as
follows. Flex items is the same order appear in the seqeunce in which they are
defined (in HTML).

If you use the `:nth-of-type()` pseudo class, it always refers to the order in
which flex items are defined, not the order defined by `order`.

## flex-wrap

Lines are defined along the `flex-direction`. By default there is only one line.
This is the case when `flex-wrap` is set to default value `nowrap`.

When `flex-wrap` is set to `wrap`, a new line is created when flex items do not
fit on existing lines. New lines are created along reading directions: top to
bottom for `flex-direction` `row` or `row-reverse` and left to right for
`flex-direction` `column` or `column-reverse`.

Everything you have learnt about other Flexbox CSS elements still applies for
each line. Except `flex-shrink`. The rule is: wrap first, then shrink.

When `flex-wrap` is set to `wrap-reverse` lines are created bottom to top
instead of top to bottom and right to left instead of left to right. This also
reverses `align-items` to keep things consistent.

## align-content

`align-content` is like `align-items` for wrapped lines. It accepts the same
values and uses the same default `stretch`. When using `align-content`, you can
think of each line as a flex item. If `flex-wrap` is set to `nowrap`,
`align-content` has no effect.

## flex

`flex` is a shortcut for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` (in that
order), e.g.

```css
flex: 1 0 auto;
```

| Setting        | Description                                                 |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flex: 2 2;`   | `flex-grow: 2;`, `flex-shrink: 2;` and `flex-basis: 0;`.    |
| `flex: 1 30px` | `flex-grow: 1;`, `flex-basis: 30px;` and `flex-shrink: 1;`. |
| `flex: 1;`     | `flex-grow: 1;`, `flex-shrink: 1;` and `flex-basis: 0;`.    |
| `flex: auto;`  | `flex-grow: 1;`, `flex-shrink: 1;` and `flex-basis: auto;`. |
| `flex: none;`  | `flex-grow: 0;`, `flex-shrink: 0;` and `flex-basis: auto;`. |

## flex-flow

Sets `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` settings in this order.
