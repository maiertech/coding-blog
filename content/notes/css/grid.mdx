Use `display: grid;` on a div to switch to grid layout. Everyting inside the div
is referred to as grid items. A grid is made up of columns and rows, which both
are referred to as tracks.

You can think of an unspecified grid as

```
grid-template-columns: 1fr;
grid-template-rows: 1fr;
```

By default, there is one column with grid items taking up the the entire width
and rendering with their intrinsic height.

`fr` takes into considerations gaps while `%` does not. If a column is `50%` of
the grid it will be 50% no matter what.

## grid-template-columns

Define columns with `grid-template-columns` by providing one or more arguments
that are either widths like `100px` or fractions of remaining space like `1fr`.
The default value is `none`.

To avoid repetition you can use `repeat` to create tracks.

```
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 100px);
```

is the same as

```
grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px 100px;
```

Spoiler alert! Above definition actually means

```
grid-template-columns: [1] 100px [2] 100px [3] 100px [4] 100px [5];
```

with line names enclosed in `[]`. Each `[]` can contain multiple names.

## grid-template-rows

Define rows with `grid-template-rows` by providing one or more arguments that
are either heights like `100px` or fractions of remaining space like `1fr`. The
default value is `none`.

To avoid repetition you can use `repeat` to create tracks.

```
grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr 2fr);
```

is the same as

```
grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 1fr 2fr;
```

Spoiler alert! Above definition actually means

```
grid-template-rows: [1] 1fr [2] 2fr [3] 1fr [4] 1fr [5];
```

with line names enclosed in `[]`. Each `[]` can contain multiple names.

## grid-gap

If you provide one value only, it sets both `grid-row-gap` and
`grid-column-gap`. If you provide two values, the first one sets `grid-row-gap`
and the second one `grid-column-gap` (rows then columns).

You can use the following units: `vw`, `vh`, `%`, `px`, `rem`. You cannot use
`fr`.

## grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start, grid-row-end

Grid lines are numbered starting with 1. Positioning is done by lines not by
tracks. Negative line numbers start at -1 from the opposite direction.

Instead of providing a line number you can indicate how many rows or columns a
grid item should span in its natural position, e.g., `span 3`. You can span in
revese direction by setting `grid-*-end` and `span x` on the corresponding
`grid-*-start`. If you set a span for both `grid-*-start` and `grid-*-end`, then
`grid-*-start` wins.

## grid-column, grid-row

`grid-*: 2 / 4;` is a shortcut for `grid-*-start: 2;` and `grid-*-end: 4;`. If
you provide only one value it's `grid-*-start`.

## Line numbers and names

When you define a grid with `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` you
can add one or more line names in `[]` in front of the track definition. If you
repeat a line name for different tracks, that line name comes with a counter
starting at 1 to identify specific lines.

Think of a line with a gap as a thick line.

## grid-area

Shorthand for `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`,
`grid-column-end` in this sequence and separated with `/` (counter clockwise
top, left, bottom, right).

You can set any value to `auto` to make it use its default positioning.
