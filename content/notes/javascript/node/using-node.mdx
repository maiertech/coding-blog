## Homebrew

The standard way of installing `node` is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install node
```

This gives you the latest version of Node, easy to update. In most cases, using
the latest version of Node, installed with Homebrew, works just fine and using
any of the options below is not needed.

## Node Version Manager (NVM)

If you need more flexibility to switch between different versions of Node,
[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is the standard option. It can be installed
with Homebrew, but requires modifying `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` to hook it up
inside your terminal:

```bash
export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
```

When setup correctly, `nvm` can automatically switch to the Node version
configured in `.nvmrc` when changing into a directory. But every team member has
to go through a manual setup to make it work and that is a big downside.

## n

[`n`](https://github.com/tj/n) is a more simple alternative to NVM that can also
be installed with Homebrew. It manages the system Node. To switch to the latest
LTS run

```bash
n lts
```

You can only have one Node version installed at a time, but `n` makes it easy to
switch between versions.

## `node` package

Projects where you need to use a specific version of Node, you can also add Node
as a dependency with package [`node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node).

When installing package `node` with `npm` it adds a path entry to a specific
version of Node that takes precedence over the system Node. But you cannot use
this option together with NVM, since NVM intercepts any invocations of Node in
your shell and launches its version of Node.

If you install package `node` with `npm` it just works and you can test running
a specific Node version with

```bash
npx node
```

If you use `yarn`, to install package `node`, the Node binary does not get
downloaded. You need to run

```bash
yarn --check-files --ignore-scripts
```

to fix this. To automate this workaround, add script

```json
"postinstall": "yarn --check-files --ignore-scripts"
```

to your `package.json` (as seen in
[this comment](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/3421#issuecomment-443972019)).

For simple projects, package `node` may be an option. However when playing
around with package node, I ran into an issue, which is a deal breaker. My
system Node was v14.2.0. I installed package `node` into a Gatsby project at
version v12.16.2. This broke the development build (after purging and
reinstalling dependencies). The moment I switched my local Node to v12 (and
after another dependency purge), everything worked fine again.

It's not clear what caused it. It may have been caused by sharp getting compiled
against the system Node and not against the `node` package.

## Enforcing a specific Node version

To enforce a specific version of Node, you can set the `engines` field in
`package.json`. But which version should you specify? The following services
have diverging requirements:

| Service                                                                                                   | Default                | Recommended semver | Comment                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/faqs#can-i-change-the-node-version-used-in-a-container-sandbox) | `10.20.1` (LTS)        | `10.x`             | System Node cannot be changed.                                                                                         |
| [GitHub Actions (`ubuntu-latest`)](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments)                       | `12.16.1`              |                    | Custom versions such as `10.x` can be specified with the [`setup-node` action](https://github.com/actions/setup-node). |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/runtimes?query=node%20version#official-runtimes/node-js/node-js-version) | latest LTS (`12.16.2`) | `12.x`             | You can also specify `10.x`, but not specific versions like `12.16.2`.                                                 |

The lowest common denominator for these services is `10.x`.
