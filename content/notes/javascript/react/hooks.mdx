Stateless components can now have state and should be referred to as functional
components. Hooks are special functions that let you hook into React features.

## Rules of hooks

1. Only call hooks at the top level of your component function, not inside
   loops, conditions or nested functions.
1. Only call hooks from function components, not regular JavaScript functions.

## useState

This is how you declare a single state variable and pass in initial state:

```
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

This is array destructuring syntax. The hook returns two values: current state
and a function to update it. React preserves this state between re-renders
(function calls). The function to update state does not merge state like `setX`
does not merge old and new state like `this.setState` in a class. It always
replaces it. You can use `useState` as many times as you want.

If you want to manage an array or an object in your state, consider using the
`useReducer` hook.

## useReducer

`useReducer` is an alternative to `useState` to manage state in a Redux like
fashion. Use this when you have complex state logic or when the next state
depends on the previous state.

```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState, init);
```

Accepts a reducer of type `(state, action) => newState`, and returns the current
state paired with a dispatch method.

The third attribute `init` is optional. It is a function that calcualtes initial
state from the second argument.

## useEffect

`useEffect` can be used for side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions or
changing the DOM manually. You can think of `useEffect` as
`componentDidMount`,`componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillMount` combined.
`useEffect` runs after every render, including the first one. We pass in a
function as argument to `useEffect` and that function is the effect. You can
create as many effects as you want.

In class components, the `render` method should not cause any side effects.
Therefore, side effects go into `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`,
which often results in code duplication, because the side effect needs to be
implemented in both lifecycle methods.

When you create effects in a class component, you set it up in
`componentDidMount` and clean it up in `componentWillUnmount`, if necesary. To
initiate a cleanup when using `useEffect`, you need to do is return a function
from `useEffect`. This can be an anonymous function. React considers the
retunred function the cleanup function and runs it before unmounting the
component and after every render. If there is nothing to clean up, so not return
a function.

Creating an effect in `componentDidMount` and cleaning up in
`componentWillUnmount` is often not enough. You need to do something in
`componentDidUpdate`, which runs after every render. E.g., you could subscripe
to a friend's status in `componentDidMount`. If the component re-renders with a
different friend you need to unsubscribe from the old friend and subscribe to
the new friend in `componentDidUpdate`. If you forget to handle the changed
friend in `componentDidUpdate`, you create a memory leak.

This is why by default the cleanup function of `useEffect` runs after every
render. However, this may result in performance problems. In
`componentDidUpdate` you can prevent an effect by checking if relevant state has
changed. For `useEffect` you can achieve the same thing, by passing in an array
of dependencies (props and state). If the array has not changed, both the effect
and the cleanup function are skipped. You can also pass in `[]`, which means
that the effect has no dependencies and does not need to be run after every
render. Cleanup will still run before unmount.

## useContext

You can think of context as global state.

```
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

Accepts a context object (the value returned from `React.createContext`, not
just the consumer or provider) and returns the current context value for that
context. The current context value is determined by the value prop of the
nearest `<MyContext.Provider>` above the calling component in the tree.

When that nearest `<MyContext.Provider>` updates, this hook will trigger a
rerender with the latest context value passed to that `MyContext` provider.

A component calling `useContext` will always re-render when the context value
changes.

## useRef

```
const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
```

`useRef` returns a mutable ref object whose `current` property is initialized to
`initialValue`. The returned object persists for the full lifetime of the
component and does not get erased when there is a re-render. You can use this to
keep any mutable value around.

But: mutating the `current` property does not trigger a re-render.

This goes beyond refs in class components, but one use case is refs in
functional components:

```
function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    // `current` points to the mounted text input element
    inputEl.current.focus();
  };
  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Custom hooks

Building your custom hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable
functions. They are a replacement for higher-order components and render props
and they do not add additional elements to the virtual DOM.

Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a
subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom
Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated.
