# Content types

My content types follow [Chris Biscardi](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/)'s pos [Content Production](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/content-production). Chris has implemented his personal website as a digital garden. The term digital garden was coined by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) and a prominent early adopter is [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) from [Egghead](https://egghead.io/).

## `note`

- Notes are a caching layer for when I am learning something new.
- Notes are organized in non-nested categories, not by date.
- The main benefits od notes are curation and interlinks.
- Notes are public, but not actively shared or promoted.
- Notes can originate from every day work, reading an article, listening to a podcast, or watching a tutorial video.

## `post`

- In posts I consolidate notes into a more permanent record.
- A post can originate from a single note that is getting too big.
- A post can originate from multiple notes about a specific topic.
- Posts are organized by date and with tags.
- Posts are actively shared and promoted.

## `tweet`

- Tweets are a way to share useful bits from a note.
- Tweets bridge the gap until a note is consolidated into a post.
- Tweets must be self-contained.
- Tweets are used to share and promote posts.
