If you don't know how to visualize your data, check this out:
https://www.data-to-viz.com/. This helps you make the right decision what
visualization to use.

Then you need to make a decision on which library to use. If you ask around,
everybody will say use [D3](https://d3js.org/). But D3 is really low level and
really complex. Therefore, I am only considering libraries that in one way or
another take the pain out of D3. This tweet show a great overview of what your
options are:

## Highcharts

https://www.highcharts.com/

Commercial charting library that is not React based.

## Nivo

https://nivo.rocks/

Very polished open source charting library built on top of D3 with React by
Raphael Benitte. Used for data visualizations for https://stateofjs.com/ and
https://stateofcss.com/. Use this library if you do not want to go into the
weeds of D3.

## React-Vis

https://uber.github.io/react-vis/

Uber's charting library based on React. Does not seem to be as polished as Nivo.

## Victory

https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/

Another solution built with React and D3 by Formidable. Great documentation,
looks polished. Probably the easiest to use but not as powerful as the others.

## visx

https://airbnb.io/visx/

Airbnb's low level data visualization primitives for React (formerly VX). You
can use this to build your own charting library.
