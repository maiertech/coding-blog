I covered debugging in VS Code in
[this thread](https://coding.maier.tech/chunks/automatic-browser-debugging/).
This worked fine on local projects, but it did not work in Codespaces. This
might be related to the fact that a codespace is a Docker container.

I summarized my findings in
[this discussion](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/3536). There
are mixed opinions on whether this should work or not. For the time being it is
best to observe this further and check again when there is a need to debug
soemthing.

Here are some related GitHub issues:
