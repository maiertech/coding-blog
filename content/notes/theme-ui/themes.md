# Themes

## Defaults

You can find theme defaults such as scales and breakpoints in the
`@theme-ui/css` package in this file:
https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/master/packages/css/src/index.ts.

In a component library you should not assume that you are using
`@theme-ui/preset-base`. The only assumption should be that you are using Theme
UI.
