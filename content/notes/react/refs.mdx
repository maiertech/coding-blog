## Class components

Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render
method. They were originally introduced for class components:

```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.myRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
}
```

In this example an instance variable is created and assigned to a component in
the `render` method us the `ref` prop. A reference to the node is available as
`this.myRef.current`:

- When `ref` is used on an HTML element, `current` contains the underlying DOM
  element.
- When `ref` is used on a custom class component, `custom` is the mounted
  instance.

## Function components

You cannot use `ref` on function components because they do not have instances:

```js
function MyFunctionComponent() {
  return <input />;
}

class Parent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    // This will *not* work!
    return <MyFunctionComponent ref={this.textInput} />;
  }
}
```

But you can use `ref` inside a function component as long as you refer to a DOM
element or a class component:

```js
function CustomTextInput(props) {
  // textInput must be declared here so the ref can refer to it
  const textInput = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    textInput.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={textInput} />
      <input type="button" value="Focus the text input" onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Forwarding refs

Ref forwarding is an opt-in feature, mostly used in component libraries, that
lets some components take a ref they receive, and pass it further down (in other
words, "forward" it) to a child.

```js
const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
  <button ref={ref} className="FancyButton">
    {props.children}
  </button>
));
```

Now we can get a ref directly to the DOM button:

```js
const ref = React.createRef();
<FancyButton ref={ref}>Click me!</FancyButton>;
```

Ref forwarding is not limited to DOM components. You can forward refs to class
component instances, too.
