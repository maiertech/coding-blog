I am still looking for a solution to create speaker decks with MDX. I had
settled for [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck). Alternatives are
[Spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/) (with optional MDX
support) and [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) (without MDX support).

At this point I am considering `mdx-deck` as unmaintained project and am looking
for an alternative.

Here are some leads:

- Revisit Spectacle. At least it is maintined.
- https://whoisryosuke.com/blog/2020/creating-speaker-decks-with-nextjs-and-mdx/

## What I wanted to achieve with `mdx-deck`

Host my presentations at `decks.maier.dev/<presentation>`.

### Option 1: `mdx-deck` and monorepo

My first try was to use package `mdx-deck` in combination with a monorepo. Each
presentation has its own `package.json` with dependencies. A custom build script
would build each presentation, copy it into a folder for consolidation and then
publish it. However, I could not figure out a way to configure `mdx-deck` to
make a build that can be served from a subdirectory.

### Option 2: Gatsby site using `gatsby-theme-mdx-deck`

This works OK enough except that the theme in v4 is very buggy. Multiple lines
of content do not distribute nicely and overflow slides. There is a white left
and top border on slides. This should be fixable, hoping for someone to fix it
or need to look myself into it.

However, using `gatsby-theme-mdx-deck` as part of an existing website does not
work since this theme cannot handle `defaultLayouts` in `gatsby-plugin-mdx`. See
this [issue](https://github.com/UNStats/covid-19-response/issues/183).
