## Symbolic links

You can add symbolic links to a Git repository. They will be stored as files and
restored as symbolic links when cloning a repository.

From within directory in which to create symbolic link run

```bash
ln -s ../undataforum/content content
```

This will be translated to file `content`

## Shallow fetch

With `git fetch` you can shorten the history of a repo based on different
criteria. This is something that GitHub Codespaces does under the hood to
accelerate spinning up new instances. You can revert this with

```bash
git fetch --unshallow
```
