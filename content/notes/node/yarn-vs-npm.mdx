## Package Management with `npm`

When you install Node via NVM, you also get the latest version of `npm`, the
Node package manager. `npm` is to Node what `gem` is to Ruby. With `npm`, you
can manage any [Node packaged modules](https://www.npmjs.org/).

NVM does not know an abstraction equivalent to RVM's gemsets. But `npm`
distinguishes between _local_ and _global_ installation:

- A _global installation_ makes a package and its documentation available on the
  command-line by installing it into Node's `lib/node-modules` directory. With
  NVM installed and Node `<version>` in use, this corresponds to
  `$HOME/.nvm/<version>/lib/node_modules`.

- A _local installation_ installs a package without documentation into the the
  `node-modules` directory of the _current directory_. Local installations can
  be used for project-specific installations into a project directory.

Unlike in bower, npm installs dependencies with each package, i.e. they may be
duplicated. That's why npm is not really suitable to manage dependencies,
because you need to cherrypick from the duplicates. Bower installes every
package exactly once.

Here is an overview of `npm` commands you should know:

| Command                        | Description                                                                                           |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm list [-g] --depth=n`      | list locally [globally] installed packages with dependencies up to depth `n` (normally use `depth=0`) |
| `npm outdated [-g] --depth=n`  | list locally [globally] outdated packages with dependencies up to depth `n` (normally use `depth=0`)  |
| `npm install <package> [-g]`   | install `<package>` locally [globally]                                                                |
| `npm update <package> [-g]`    | update `<package>` locally [globally]                                                                 |
| `npm update`                   | update local packages according to `package.json`                                                     |
| `npm uninstall <package> [-g]` | uninstall `<package>` locally [globally]                                                              |
| `npm search <string>`          | search for available packages containing `<string>`                                                   |
| `npm prune`                    | prune local packages not listed in local `package.json` (use within project directory)                |
