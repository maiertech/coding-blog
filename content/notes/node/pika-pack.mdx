I am currently using [Microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) to
bundle my React component libraries. I use it because I saw Theme UI use it and
it was a quick way of cranking out packages that are CJS and ESM. But it does
not feel right.

This is really a universal tool, it's not just for one use case like TSDX.
