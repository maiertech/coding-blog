## Introduction

- [Introducing: @pika/pack](https://www.pika.dev/blog/introducing-pika-pack) is
  the official manual.
- [Pika/Pack and the Future of Front-end Development](https://manifold.co/blog/pika-pack-and-the-future-of-front-end-development)
  is a closer look at @pika/pack, but it's from June 2019.
- The [pika-pack-builders](https://github.com/snowpackjs/pika-pack-builders)
  repository documents official @pika/pack plugins and serves as an example of
  how to use @pika/pack in a monorepo.

## Should I still use @pika/pack?

@pika/pack has moved under the [snowpackjs](https://github.com/snowpackjs) org
on GitHub. But it has
[not been maintained in a while](https://github.com/snowpackjs/pack). So I asked
[in this tweet](https://twitter.com/maiertech/status/1358818194853670912)
whether or not it should still be used.
[This tweet](https://twitter.com/skypackjs/status/1358824561266032642) suggests
that development has stopped.
