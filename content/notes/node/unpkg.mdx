  contents of any package published to NPM.

The original goal of [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) was to make
[UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds of
[NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) availalbe on a CDN. Before we had
[ES modules (ESM)](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/),
UMD was the choice to build universal modules that run in browsers and Node.

NPM packages were originally compatible with
[CommonJS (CJS)](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) only. CJS was the only
module system that Node supported. The
[`main`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#main) field
in `package.json` was the only entry point for Node packages and it had to be
compatible with CJS. Subsequently, the
[`browser`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#browser)
field was added to `package.json` as an alterantive entry point for packages
with code intended to run in a browser. This is where UMD builds come in handy,
because they are compatible with both `main` and `browser`.

UMD is obsolete since Node supports ESM making them the preferred choice for
universal modules moving forward.

## What does unpkg do?

- It serves up npm packages.
- By default the file linked in `main` in `package.json`.
- E.g. https://unpkg.com/react redirects to
  https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.1/index.js.
- Go to https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.1/ to obtain a directory listing.
- You can locate the UMD build and the get the URL.
- You work with globals and include script tags that link to UMD builds on
  unpkg. This is as basic as it gets.
- Later on webpack said: let me create the script tags for you.
- You can still use webpack to bundle your app, but pull out react as separate
  script tag loaded from unpkg. The advantage would be that you don't force
  people to download react for every single page and instead allow them to use
  the cached version.

https://www.skypack.dev/ can be considered as the successor of UNPKG.
