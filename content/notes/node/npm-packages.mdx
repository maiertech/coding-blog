## The goal

Create NPM packages with at least CommonJS (CJS) and ES modules (ESM) support
that result in a decent
[Skypack package quality score](https://docs.skypack.dev/package-authors/package-checks).
Because this opens the door to using my packages with a modern bundlerless stack
such as [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/). The score does not need to be
perfect, because I can improve it over time.

## To bundle or not to bundle

You do not need to use a bundler to create NPM packages. But with a bundler you
can more easily create packages with multiple entry points to support CJS, ESM
and UMD with in single package. Additional benefits include:

- A bundler can bundle only what the package actually needs and tree shake
  dependencies. This is important for UMD packages, which bundle all
  dependencies to make them loadable in a browser.
- A bundler can optimize CSS or package assets.

## Tools to create NPM packages

Candidate tools are
[zero-config presets](https://tooling.js.org/?id=%f0%9f%94%a5-zero-config-presets)
and [bundlers](https://tooling.js.org/?id=%f0%9f%9a%9a-bundlers).

### No bundler

This [blog post](https://2ality.com/2019/10/hybrid-npm-packages.html) discusses
options to manually create NPM packages that support ESM and CJS. If you do not
bundle your package, you need to be aware of all the things that ESM does not
support, e.g. if you require CJS from ESM, named imports do not work. There is a
workaround, package [esm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm), but it adds one
more tool to your stack (which is not a bundler).

### Rollup

[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) is the bundler that introduced tree
shaking. It can do static code analysis and include only named imports into the
bundle. Rollup is very powerful, but it is not for the faint of heart. Nothing I
want to use directly. But there are a number of more developer friendly tools
that are built with Rollup (more below).

### Webpack

Webpack powers big portions of the React world: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). You can also
[use Webpack to bundle libraries](https://webpack.js.org/guides/author-libraries/).
Like Rollup, Webpack is very powerful, but not for the faint of heart.

### Microbundle (based on Rollup)

[Microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) positions itself as
zero-configuration bundler for tiny modules. But it is not clear how tiny
modules should be for Microbundle to make sense. I started using Microbundle for
packages in my
[design system repository](https://github.com/maiertech/design-system) because I
built my design system with [Theme UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui),
which at the time used Microbundle for its packages. Version
[0.13.0](https://github.com/developit/microbundle/tree/v0.13.0) was very stable
and I managed to build ESM and CJS compatible packages that yielded score in the
80s on [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) without much effort.

### @pika/pack (based on Rollup)

I had a closer look at
[@pika/pack](https://www.pika.dev/blog/introducing-pika-pack), but I was
trailing the hype curve by about a year. @pika/pack is is a build pipeline for
NPM packages. It mostly revolves around choosing good defaults for tools like
Babel and Rollup. I looked at the following posts and repos:

- [Introducing: @pika/pack](https://www.pika.dev/blog/introducing-pika-pack)
  (official manual).
- [Pika/Pack and the Future of Front-end Development](https://manifold.co/blog/pika-pack-and-the-future-of-front-end-development)
  is a closer look at @pika/pack (in June 2019).
- The [pika-pack-builders](https://github.com/snowpackjs/pika-pack-builders)
  repository documents official @pika/pack plugins and serves as an example how
  to use @pika/pack in a monorepo.

@pika/pack has moved under the auspices of
[snowpackjs](https://github.com/snowpackjs) on GitHub. But as of February 2021,
it has
[not been maintained in quite a while](https://github.com/snowpackjs/pack). So I
asked [in this tweet](https://twitter.com/maiertech/status/1358818194853670912)
whether or not it was still a viable option. Unfortunately,
[this tweet](https://twitter.com/skypackjs/status/1358824561266032642) suggests
that development has stopped.

### Preconstruct (based on Rollup)

### TSDX (based on Rollup)

[TSDX](https://tsdx.io/) is another opinionated zero-config preset to build NPM
packages for libraries written in TypeScript. It supports CJS, ESM and UMD.
There is no documentation on monorepo support. But there are two open issues
with pointers:

- https://github.com/formium/tsdx/issues/122
- https://github.com/formium/tsdx/issues/275

And you can look at the following reference repositories:

- https://github.com/formium/formik
- https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx-monorepo

You can also install a starter and look at how things need to be wired up in a
normal repository. The biggest benefit of TSDX is that bundles development
dependencies and configuration into one dependency. A variant of TSDX for
monorepos called [TurboRepo](https://turborepo.com/) is currently under
development.

TSDX uses Babel to transpile TypeScript into JavaScript.

### Parcel

By coincidence I looked at how the
[radix-ui/primitives](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives) repository handles
packages. It turns out that with [Parcel v2](https://v2.parceljs.org/) you can
[bundle NPM packages](https://v2.parceljs.org/getting-started/library/).
Unfortunately, this is not properly documented yet.

radix-ui/primitives is using a bleeding edge Parcel v2 nightly build with the
default configuration to build all packages in a monorepo. There are a few
caveats, e.g.
[how Parcel processes TypeScript](https://v2.parceljs.org/languages/typescript/).
This [issue](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/4797) suggests that
this is bleeding edge an probably not a good choice until Parcel v2 is out.

### Neutrino (based on Webpack)

For the sake of completeness, [Neutrino](https://neutrinojs.org/) is zero-config
preset based on Webpack. I had never seen it in my Twitter feed and therefore
did not look into it.

## So which tool should I use?
