After inital poking around a bit, it dawns on me that migrating a library to
TypeScript is a major project.

## TSC vs. Babel

First, TSC analyzes your code and does type checking. After your code
successfully passes type checking, TSC compiles (or transpiles) TypeScript into
JavaScript. It can output regular JavaScript, ESM or CJS. TSC is the best way to
do type checking.

If you have an existing build pipeline, e.g. one that runs with Babel, you can
use [preset-typescript](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript) to
do the transpile step. You still need to use TSC for type checking, which your
text editor can do for you or you can run it in CI on pull requests. The Babel
route is a good way to ease into TypeScript. The advantage of using Babel is
that you can use JavaScript features that are not yet supported in TypeScript.
