TSDX positions itself as zero-config CLI for TypeScript package development. It
can create NPM packages that support CJS, ESM and UMD. It is opinionated about
how packages should be created and wires up

## Introduction

## How to go about an existing package

There is no documentation on how to migrate an existing package to TSDX. You can
