Different projects may require different Node versions. In the past I would
reach out for one of these tools:

## NVM

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

| Command                       | Description                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nvm ls-remote`               | list all Node versions that can be installed (check latest stable version on [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)) |
| `nvm install <version>`       | install Node `<version>`                                                                                       |
| `nvm ls`                      | list installed Node versions                                                                                   |
| `nvm use <version>`           | use Node `<version>`                                                                                           |
| `nvm use`                     | use Node version from `.nvmrc` file                                                                            |
| `nvm alias default <version>` | make Node `<version>` default                                                                                  |
| `nvm uninstall <version>`     | uninstall Node.js `<version>`                                                                                  |

Use `which node` to figure out which Node version is active.

## Nodenv

## n

## Node via Homebrew

This is good enough for local development, especially when you work with
Codespaces or containers.

## Other approaches

Node is not the only piece of your development environment that you want to
manage. There are more. Therefore, you need to manage more thatn just a Node
installation. Use Codespaces/containers and you have you entire development
environment managed, not just one piece.
