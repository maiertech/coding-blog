[`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx)
gives your three things:

1. It gives you an out-of-the-box experience for any MDX files located in
   `src/pages`.
1. It allows you processing custom node collections, e.g. `File` nodes or nodes
   with a specific media type.
1. It configures the `@mdx-js/loader` for you so you can import an MDX file and
   use it as component.

## Processing custom node collections

`gatsby-plugin-mdx` processes `.mdx` `File` nodes by default. You can add more
extensions with the `extensions` theme option. It also processes non-`File`
nodes with media type `text/markdown` or `text/x-markdown`. You can add more
media types with the `mediaTypes` theme option.

If you need to process a chunk of Markdown, you can create a node and set its
media type to one of the supported media types. This will trigger processing its
`internal.content` prop.

This is a great example of how to define a complex type with complex resolvers:
https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/gatsby/source-nodes.js.
It's also a reminder that the secret sauce of types are resolvers.

This part of the `Mdx` type definition

```
extensions: {
  childOf: {
    mimeTypes: options.mediaTypes,
  },
},
```

creates a `childMdx` prop on the parent node and links the `Mdx` node to in the
parent's children.
