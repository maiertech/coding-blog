## Node ownership

Nodes are owned by the plugins that create them. You can look up node ownership
under the `internal.owner` field. Once a node has been created by a plugin, it
cannot be altered by another plugin. With one exception: you can use the
[`createNodeField`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/actions/#createNodeField)
action to add a field to a node that a plugin does not own. The plugin eill then
own that field.

## Node API

### createSchemaCustomization

Use `createSchemaCustomization` Node API method to get access to the
`createTypes` action. This action is used to define GraphQL types using the
[GraphQL schema definition language](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-system).

The following customization controls can be applied to types:

| Control      | Description                                                     |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@infer`     | Anything which does not exist on the type will be inferred.     |
| `@dontInfer` | Anything which does not exist on the type will not be inferred. |

The following extensions can be applied to interfaces:

| Extension        | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@nodeInterface` | Treat interface like a top level type that implements the `Node` interface. The `Node` interface adds `<type>` and `all<Type>` queries. |

The following extensions add resolver options to fields of a type:

| Extension             | Description                                   |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `@dateformat`         | Add additional query options to a date field. |
| `@link`               | Connect to a different node.                  |
| `@fileByRelativePath` | Connect to a file node. Same as `@link`.      |
| `@proxy`              | Proxy field names from underlying node.       |

Extensions can be used on interfaces. But not all of them make sense on an
interfaces. Lets take `Event` (interface) and `MdxEvent` (type as an example).
Defining `startDate` as `Date! @dateformat` means that wherever `Event` gets
`startDate` from, we add additional formatting capabilities.

We define `description` as `EventDescription!` on `Event` but on `MdxEvent` we
define it as `description: EventDescription! @link`. In this case `@link` is an
implementation detail in which we explicitly link an `EventDescription` node
through its ID. Interface `Event` does not care about this implementation detail
and just says what `description` should look like. In this case `@link` on the
`Event` interface makes no sense.

Same for `@fileByRelativePath`. All interface `Event` says is that
`attachements` aren array of `File`. But it does not care if this was created by
linking nodes.

### createResolvers

If you used the `createTypes` action to define types, you need a way to define
resolvers for any fields whose value does not live on the node and needs to be
resolved.

You basically create an object with type names as props and then field names
with their resolvers. You can also use the alternative API to do this via
`schema.buildObjectType` where you can co-locate fields and their resolvers. See
[here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/gatsby/source-nodes.js)
for an example.

### onCreateNode

`onCreateNode` is intended to be used for plugins that wish to extend or
transform nodes created by other plugins. Therefore, nodes created within
`onCreateNode` should always have `parent.id` set. Nodes created by
`onCreateNode` that do not have a parent assigned, will get erased from the
Gatsby cache.

You do not have access to `graphql` in `onCreateNode`.

### sourceNodes

Extension point to source nodes from whatever source. You do not have access to
`graphql` to query the Gatsby graph, but you can of course source nodes from
GraphQL APIs.
