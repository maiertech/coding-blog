The main thing to know is that the config files will be consolidated against the
hierarchy theyâ€™re included. So the top-most config will win if there are
clashes.

This probably means that there is no real deduplication and that each plugin
will be run at it's specified verions. If plugins are duplicate they will run
multiple times and the definition/version higher up in the list is the one that
wins. There is probably nothing really sophistocated happening here!

Try to avoid diverging versions of packages! Because you may have issues.

## Resolutions

Here is an example where I end up with different versions of gatsb-plugin-sharp,
even though it makes no sense:

```bash
yarn why v1.22.5
[1/4] Why do we have the module "gatsby-plugin-sharp"...?
[2/4] Initialising dependency graph...
[3/4] Finding dependency...
[4/4] Calculating file sizes...
=> Found "gatsby-plugin-sharp@2.14.0"
info Reasons this module exists
   - "@maiertech#gatsby-theme-digital-garden#@maiertech#gatsby-theme-pages-core" depends on it
   - Hoisted from "@maiertech#gatsby-theme-digital-garden#@maiertech#gatsby-theme-pages-core#gatsby-plugin-sharp"
info Disk size without dependencies: "1.73MB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "49.09MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "126.52MB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 249
=> Found "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core#gatsby-plugin-sharp@2.14.1"
info This module exists because "@maiertech#gatsby-theme-digital-garden#@maiertech#gatsby-theme-posts-core" depends on it.
info Disk size without dependencies: "1.04MB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "48.4MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "125.84MB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 249
Done in 2.08s.
```

It caused this error:

```bash
 ERROR

Gatsby-plugin-sharp wasn't setup correctly in gatsby-config.js. Make sure you add it to the plugins array.

not finished run static queries - 4.077s

error Command failed with exit code 1.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
```

Not clear why Yarn went with two different versions. Here I need to force the
latest version of gatsby

This [issue](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/1345) is an example
where conflicting versions of a package result in a problem. When it is not
possible to resolve the version conflict by pinning dependencies, you can force
a dependency to be resovled to a specific version using the `resolutions` prop
in your project root `package.json`.

Temporarily add this to fix it and then run yarn and remove it again.

```json
"resolutions": {
  "gatsby-plugin-sharp": "^2.14.1"
}
```

alternatively, you could have removes @maiertech/gatsby-theme-digital-garden and
add it again.

## Definitions

- Themes are plugins that include a `gatsby-config.js`.
- Themes that are configured in `gatsby-config.js` are called sibling themes.
- A theme that is used by another theme is called parent theme. In other words:
  any theme defined in a theme's `gatsby-config.js` is a parent theme.

## Composition

Your site's `gatsby-config.js` defines a `plugins` array that contains plugins
and themes. Each theme in the `plugins` array comes with a `gatsby-config.js`
that needs to be somehow merged with the site's `gatsby-config.js`. The problem
of merging all configs can be broken down to merging two configs. Every prop in
a `gatsby-config.js`, but the `plugins` prop, is deep merged. In a deep merge
the last value always wins.

How are two `plugins` arrays merged? Use these simple rules:

1. The initial merge step starts with an empty consolidation array, which will
   hold the result of the current merge step. Start iterating through the
   `plugins` array of the site's `gatsby-config.js`.
1. If the current element is a plugin, add it to the consolidation array.
1. If the current element is a theme, recursively start a new merge step using
   that theme's `plugins` array and a separate consolidation array for this
   step. Start iterating through the theme's `plugins` array and process plugins
   and themes. the resulting consolidation array then needs to be merged into
   the consolidation array of the previous merge step.
1. Plugins are normalized to make it easier to figure out whether two plugins
   are duplicates, factoring in options. When mergin a consolidation array into
   a consolidation array one recursion step higher, only keep the first
   occurrence of a duplicate.
1. At the end of every merge step the consolidation array contains plugins only,
   no themes.

In the consolidated array plugins are ordered in the sequence in which sibling
themes are defined. For each sibling theme its parent themes go first (in the
sequence in which they are defined), then the theme itself and then the
following sibling's parent themes and so on. Keep in mind that themes are
eventually replaced with a collection of plugins that make up a theme. The
consolidated array does not contain duplicates (meaning the same plugin with the
same options), but it can contain the same plugin with different options. For
some plugins, such as
[`gatsby-source-filesystem`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem),
multiple occurrences of this plugin are no issue. In this example multiple
occurrences define multiple file locations to be processed by Gatsby. For other
plugins, such as
[`gatsby-plugin-theme-ui`](https://theme-ui.com/packages/gatsby-plugin/),
multiple occurrences overwrite each other and the last occurrence wins. Options
of previous occurrences are not merged.

Component shadowing can be done in a site or in any plugin, including themes.
The consolidated array also defines how component shadowing works. If the same
file is shadowed in more than one location, the follwoing rules apply:

- Shadowing in the site always takes precedence over any other location.
- The first shadowing plugin of the sequence described above wins.

See
[this file](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/utils/merge-gatsby-config.ts)
for the algorithm to merge `gatsby-config.js` files.

## Authoring Themes

When authoring a theme, we need to ensure that it is self-contained and does not
interfere with other themes or the actual Gatsby site. In this section I
collected approaches I came across to achieve this.

### Separate logic from layout

In this approach you separate theme logic from theme layout. For example,
[`gatsby-theme-blog-core`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog-core)
contains theme logic with unstyled pages that are meant to be shadowed.
[`gatsby-theme-blog`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog)
shadows all pages and adds layouts. Adding layouts is very opinionated and this
architecture

### Separate context

Some libraries such as [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/home) or
[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) work with a shared context
(called provider) that is normally established in `wrapRootElement`. For
example, Theme UI uses a `ThemeProvider`. If both the site and a theme configure
a `ThemeProvider` with their own design tokens via `wrapRootElement`, you end up
with a conflict. If you really need two different sets of design tokens, one in
the theme and another one in the rest of the site, you can create a separate
context in your theme and use that context in all your components. Check out
[this example](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advanced-gatsby-themes-workshop-code/tree/06-mdx-blog-posts).

If your plan is to use only one set of design tokens on your entire website,
then can work with a plugin. For example,
[`gatsby-plugin-theme-ui`](https://theme-ui.com/packages/gatsby-plugin/)
establishes the context for you. You can use this plugin in your theme and in
your site and based on what was discussed before, the plugin config of the site
will be used.

### Explicit and implicit dependencies

You can think of the GraphQL graph that Gatsby creates as one big global graph.
Every plugin manipulates the same global graph. This is a blessing and a curse.
It's a blessing beacause you can create very powerful queries across different
data sources. It's a curse because because a global graph can lead to undesired
side effects when composing themes.

Let's assume we have two themes: `gatsby-theme-blog` to manage posts and
`gatsby-theme-profiles` to manage author profiles. In order to link to author
profiles from a post, `gatsby-theme-blog` needs to query nodes in the global
graph that are managed by `gatsby-theme-profiles`.

You can make `gatsby-theme-profiles` a parent theme and explicit dependency in
`gatsby-theme-blog`. Then `gatsby-theme-blog` controls `gatsby-theme-profiles`
in the sense that it sets its options. But it does not control the graph.
Another theme could use `gatsby-theme-profiles` and add more profiles. This is
the problem with Gatsby's graph, every plugins can mess with it.

But what can you do if you want to share the same profile collection across
multiple themes? Each theme could use `gatsby-theme-profiles` as parent theme.
If theme options for `gatsby-theme-profiles` are identical, there should be no
issues with duplicate pages being generated. But you might run into issues when
different themes use different versions of `gatsby-theme-profiles`. You could
decide against making `gatsby-theme-profiles` a dependency in any theme using it
and would end up creating an implicit dependency because your theme still
queries nodes that it did not create. Alterantively, you could let your theme
only query data it controls and make a hook availalbe in `gatsby-theme-profiles`
that other themes can import and use to query and filter all profiles. This
seems a cleaner solution, because the depedency is explicit, but there are no
queries to any data that your theme does not control.

**It looks like one lesson learned is that it is a bad idea if a theme queries
nodes that it did not create.**

You should examine your theme if you make the implicit assumption that it is
used only once. For example, if you configure above mentioned
`gatsby-theme-blog` twice with different locations from which to create posts
and profiles, they would still end up in one global posts collection and one
global profiels collection. Your theme should add options to allow being
confiugred multiple times in a meaningful way.

**A theme cannot be configured more than once in a site, unless you add theme
options to make using it more than once meaningful.**

## Webpack

It is important to mention that Gatsby themes are buil on webpack and the
component shadowing mechanism is follows webpack's way of resolving modules.
This means that a core functionality of Gatsby is married to Webpack and will
make it difficult long term to move away from Webpack.

## Static files

In dev static files from a theme are not copied to `public`, see
https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/14003. Files from themes are copied
during build. If there are conflicting files, processing sequence matters. Site
static files always win.

See https://github.com/maiertech/gatsby-themes/issues/125.

## Recommendations

- [`gatsby-theme-blog`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog)
- [`gatsby-theme-notes`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-notes)
- [Reflex](https://reflexjs.org/) is a collection og packages and Gatsby themes.
  Awesome material to learn from.
- [Doctocat](https://github.com/primer/doctocat) is backed by GitHub and a
  pretty polished theme that is suitable to document component libraries.
- Book: https://github.com/SaraVieira/gatsby-starter-book
- Still need to vet [Catalyst](https://www.gatsbycatalyst.com/) to see if its
  good quality.
- [gatsby-theme-courses](https://github.com/hangindev/gatsby-theme-courses):
  check if this can be used as basis for a course platform.
