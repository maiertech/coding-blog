Gatsby has just launched
[`gatsby-theme-i18n`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-i18n)
with
[this introductory post](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-07-28-introducing-gatsby-i18n-theme/).
Prior art is covered in
[this post](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-07-13-i18n-pain-points/). You can
explore `gatsby-theme-i18n` by looking at the
[official starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/starters/example-i18n).
For this note I looked at v1.0.2. I go over how it works and what can be
improved.

## What would the perfect `gatsby-theme-i18n` look like?

- It should be possible to use `gatsby-theme-i18n` with other themes, such as
  [`gatsby-theme-blog`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog)
  or
  [`gatsby-theme-notes`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-notes),
  without having to modify and re-release these themes.
- If modifications in other themes need to be made to make localization work, it
  should be possible to make them using
  [shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/).
- As much of the localization heavy lifting should be made inside
  `gatsby-theme-i18n` and not outside of it.

As we will see further down, these points are ambitions and we will have to make
compromises.

## How `gatsby-theme-i18n` v1 works

There are two types of pages that this plugin can handle:

- **Content pages:** MDX files with content, e.g., a blog post. Most of the time
  you use another theme such as `gatsby-theme-blog` to organize content pages.
  In this note I refer to the theme used for organizing MDX files as MDX theme.
  MDX themes ususally define a custom way of managing MDX files, e.g.,
  organizing them in a `content` directory.
- **General pages:** are usually defined in `src/pages` as JavaScript files.
  They contain a React component that is able to adapt based on the locale
  passed in via context. Examples are an overview page that lists blog posts, a
  404 page or the homepage. These pages use one of the packages mentioned
  [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-07-28-introducing-gatsby-i18n-theme/#can-i-use-i18n-library-x-with-this-theme)
  to localize their content.

`gatsby-theme-i18n` brings the following features to the table:

### Localization components and hooks

Components that make creating localized pages easier, e.g.,

- `LocalizedLink` (for internal links) that helps linking to the right page
  depending on the locale.
- `MdxLink`, which is a replacement for `a` in MDX files.

The full list of components and hooks can be found
[here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-i18n#available-react-componentshooks).

### A naming convention for localized content files

`gatsby-theme-i18n` defines a default locale, e.g., `en`. Let's assume you have
a content file `path/to/index.mdx` in the default locale `en`. To add
translations for locales `fr` and `ru` you add `path/to/index.fr.mdx` and
`path/to/index.ru.mdx`.

`onCreateNode` in `gatsby-node.js` derives the locale from the file name for
each MDX node and adds fields `locale` and `default`, which are then availalbe
for querying MDX nodes.

Note that the suffix has to be `.mdx` and not `.md` because of
[this line](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/blob/9461a6f84a92b8cf10c11a8a1079f9f2ced57966/packages/gatsby-theme-i18n/gatsby-node.js#L121)
and you always have to name a content file in the default locale `index.mdx`
because of
[this line](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/blob/9461a6f84a92b8cf10c11a8a1079f9f2ced57966/packages/gatsby-theme-i18n/gatsby-node.js#L123).
Both restrictins probably need a little more flexibility in future versions of
`gatsby-theme-i18n`.

### Grouping translations that belong together

In above example, `index.mdx`, `index.fr.mdx` and `index.ru.mdx` belong together
since they are translated versions of each other, but each file is not aware
that other translations exist. In the current starter, translations of the same
content are linked via a `slug` prop with the same value in the frontmatter of
each file. We will see further down the implications of this convention.

### `onCreatePage` in `gatsby-node.js`

In General, this Gatsby Node API method can be used to manipulate the page
context that is used to create a page. `gatsby-theme-i18n` leverages this API to
create localized pages with localized paths by triggering a `createPage` for
each locale. It uses `originalPath` as a signal to detect if the current page
has been processed already to avoid infinite loops.

At this point you should have a look at the
[source code](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/blob/9461a6f84a92b8cf10c11a8a1079f9f2ced57966/packages/gatsby-theme-i18n/gatsby-node.js#L132-L161)
to understand what is happening in this method and why it is so powerful for
localization purposes.

This is what `onCreatePage` does for general pages (as defined further up): say
you have `src/pages/about.js` with locales `en` (default), `fr` and `ru`. The
method discards any page that may have been created for path `/about/` and
generates the following localized pages:

- `/about/` for `en`,
- `/fr/about/` for `fr` and
- `/ru/about/` for `ru`.

Since you get `originalPath` and all locales via context, you can derive all
paths that you need for a helper component to switch between languages.

For content pages (as defined further up), on the other hand, you have one file
per language, e.g. `path/to/index.mdx` for default `en`, `path/to/index.fr.mdx`
and `path/to/index.ru.mdx`. As mentioned before, each file has a frontmatter
prop with the same slug, say `some-slug`, which is also used as path.

You need to remember that your MDX theme defines a template that comes with a
query that is used to select an MDX node and then create a page from it. You can
look at such a template in the
[official starter](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-theme-i18n/blob/284e3f67de8c955a89abfa082510516ae40cccb7/src/templates/blog-template.js#L1-L40).
Because `index.mdx`, `index.fr.mdx` and `index.ru.mdx` all use the same path,
page generation is triggered for only one of theses files (I'm guessing here
based on what I see in the debugger, because I am not familiar with Gatsby's
page generation internals). This page generation is intercepted by
`onCreatePage` and replaced with `createPage` calls for each locale. The result
are the following pages:

- `/some-slug/` for default `en`,
- `/fr/some-slug/` and
- `/ru/some-slug/`.

Note that `fr` and `ru` also use the same slug as the `en` page. This is not
ideal and I will revisit this point further down.

Also note that the template's query uses `locale` and `slug` to retrieve the MDX
node that contains the correct localized content. As a side effect, if for one
locale there is no translation, the template's query returns `null` and no page
is created (I'm guessing again and might be wrong).

The behavior of not generating a page when a translation is missing is a
blessing and a curse. A blessing, because in my opinion it makes no sense to
show an English fallback page when you are Russian speaking only and expect to
see a Russian article. A curse, because a helper component to switch between
languages needs to take this into consideration and avoid linking to translation
that does not exist.

## How to improve `gatsby-theme-i18n` v1

At this point I realize that `gatsby-theme-i18n` provides some powerful
localization mechanisms, but some heavy lifitng is also done inside the MDX
theme. E.g., the MDX theme needs to ensure that the frontmatter `slug` ends up
in the context and can be passed on to `createPage` and on to the template when
creating localized pages. And we did all this under the assumption that all
translations contain the same frontmatter slug.

Here is my wishlist:

1. I want to be able to use localized slugs for translated pages. This means
   that we need to find a way to link translations together other than through a
   shared slug.
1. A helper component to switch between languages needs to be aware of which
   translations exist. Only then can it ensure that it does not link to a
   translation that does not exist. In practice, you should never assume that
   you have translations of every content page in every language. Usually you
   start with the default language and over time you add more translations, but
   you rarely reach 100% translation coverage.

### `contentId`

If we introduced a `contentId` to identify translations that belong together, we
could

1. allow defining localized slugs in the frontmatter of content files,
1. query all available translations and corresponding localized slugs inside of
   `onCreatePage` and pass them on to `createPage` via context for a helper
   component to switch languages.

Unfortunately, it is not enough to just define `contentId` in MDX frontmatter.
`contentId` needs to make its way into the context for it to be accessible
inside `onCreatePage`. This would require adapting and re-releasing the MDX
theme (you would need to modify `createPages` inside the MDX theme's
`gatsby-node.js`). You may not have control over that MDX theme. We also need to
adapt the template query. This could be done via shadowing. But since we have to
modify the MDX theme anyway, the template query should be modified in there.

Making a MDX theme compatible with `gatsby-theme-i18n` would then mean mean
adding support for `contentId`.

### Impact on `LocalizedLink`

Currently, `LocalizedLink` relies on
[`localizedPath`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/blob/9461a6f84a92b8cf10c11a8a1079f9f2ced57966/packages/gatsby-theme-i18n/src/helpers.js#L5-L22),
which relies on translations using the same frontmatter slug. `LocalizedLink`
would need to change its API to allow using `contentId` for the `to` prop and
then let it figure out which localized path to supply to `Link` (based on the
locale).
