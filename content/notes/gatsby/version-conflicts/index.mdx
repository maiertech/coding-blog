## Conflicting plugin versions

When `gatsby-config.js` files are merged and deduplicated, package versions are
not taken into consideration. When Gatsby runs methods from the Gatsby Node API,
it seems to use the version that has been hoisted.

I tested this for plugins `gatsby-transformer-sharp` and
`gatbsy-source-filesystem` in @maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages and
@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts by pinning one package that both use to different
versions. In principle, different plugin versions are not a problem, but you
cannot predict which version gets hoisted (unless you have the plugin also in
your website, which would then take precedence). But as the following section
shows, there might still be plugins that cause issues when there are multiple
versions of it in your dependencies.

## gatsby-plugin-sharp

gatsby-plugin-sharp breaks when used at different versions. In
@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core I pinned gatsby-plugin-sharp to 2.14.1 and in
@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core I pinned gatsby-plugin-sharp to 2.12.0.

This triggered the following error:

```bash
 ERROR

Gatsby-plugin-sharp wasn't setup correctly in gatsby-config.js. Make sure you add it to the plugins array.

not finished run static queries - 4.077s

error Command failed with exit code 1.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
```

Running `yarn why gatbsy-plugin-sharp` reveals that version 2.12.0 has been
hoisted while version 2.14.1 lives is a non-hoisted dependency. I would expect
Gatsby to use the hoisted version only.

```bash
yarn why v1.22.5
[1/4] Why do we have the module "gatsby-plugin-sharp"...?
[2/4] Initialising dependency graph...
[3/4] Finding dependency...
[4/4] Calculating file sizes...
=> Found "gatsby-plugin-sharp@2.12.0"
info Reasons this module exists

info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "126.48MB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 260
Done in 5.39s.
```

The error happens in gatsby-plugin-sharp's index.js in a function called
[`createJob`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/6b93c1cd2a9eaa13948edbd3615e5cbaefa35766/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/src/index.js#L128-L132).
This function checks whether an actions object with Redux actions has been set.
This is supposed to happen in
[onPreBootstrap](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/6b93c1cd2a9eaa13948edbd3615e5cbaefa35766/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/src/gatsby-node.js#L108),
which is part of Gatsby's Node API. Gatsby calls `onPreBootstrap` on
gatsby-plugin-sharp version 2.12.0, which is the hoisted version. I could
confirm with a `console.log` that above error is thrown in the `index.js` file
of version 2.14.1, which never received an actions object.

As I discussed in the Yarn post, Yarn always honors specified NPM package
versions. In this case I specified in @maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core to use
gatsby-plugin-sharp version 2.14.1 only. Therefore, when Gatsby extracts and
compiles GraphQL queries for @maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core, it uses
gatsby-plugin-sharp at version 2.14.1, for which actions have never been set
because this happens only for the hoisted version.

## Fixing the problem

We now know that it is better to avoid having the same plugin at different
versions in your Gatsby config. If you have control over the themes that you are
using, make sure that all themes have matching version specifications for all
Gatsby plugins used by more than one theme. This is what I do with the themes I
maintain in @maiertech/gatsby-themes.

When you use two or more third party themes in your Gatsby site, you have no
control over the dependencies that these themes use. You will probably be fine
if themes specificy their dependencies with a caret (`^`), since Yarn can then
hoist versions of dependecies that match what is required in all themes. But
there is no guarantee. All it takes is one theme that is outdated and you could
end up with a nasty bug along the lines just discussed.

But Yarn offers you an escape hatch. You can add a
[resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/)
prop to your root `package.json`, which forces the specified version of a
package to be hoisted used whereever that package is imported, no matter what
other package.json file might say. To solve above problem, you temporaily add

```json
"resolutions": {
  "gatsby-plugin-sharp": "^2.14.1"
}
```

to your `package.sjon` and run `yarn install`. This will update `yarn.lock` and
make sure that there is only one entry for `gatsby-plugin-sharp`.

## One more example

```bash
 ERROR #85919  GRAPHQL

Found two different GraphQL fragments with identical name "PageFragment". Fragment names must be unique

  File: /home/node/workspace/covid-19-response/node_modules/@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core/src/page-fragment.js
  > 1 | fragment PageFragment on Page{id title description images{childImageSharp{gatsbyImageData}}body path canonicalUrl}
|             ^^^^^^^^^^^^

  File:
/home/node/workspace/covid-19-response/node_modules/@undataforum/gatsby-theme-base/node_modules/@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core/src/page-fragment.js
  > 1 | fragment PageFragment on Page{id title description image body path canonicalUrl}
|             ^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core should be included only once, but it looks
like we have it twice:

```bash
yarn why v1.22.5
[1/4] Why do we have the module "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core"...?
[2/4] Initialising dependency graph...
[3/4] Finding dependency...
[4/4] Calculating file sizes...
=> Found "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core@0.5.0"
info Has been hoisted to "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core"
info This module exists because it's specified in "dependencies".
info Disk size without dependencies: "76KB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "8.05MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "76KB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 372
=> Found "@undataforum/gatsby-theme-base#@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core@0.4.0"
info This module exists because "@undataforum#gatsby-theme-base" depends on it.
info Disk size without dependencies: "72KB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "8.05MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "72KB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 372
Done in 1.79s.
```

@undataforum/gatsby-theme-base depends on version 0.4.0, while the website uuses
version 0.5.0. I could now re-release @undataforum/gatsby-theme-base with the
correct versions or i can pull the resolutions trick.

Resolutions workaround requires you to leave the resoutions in package.json.
Otherwise yarn.lock will be reverted.
