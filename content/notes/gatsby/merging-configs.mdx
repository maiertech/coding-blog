[Gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/) (referred to as themes)
are packaged Gatsby websites that can be shipped as NPM packages. Themes make it
easy to get a new website off the ground. They are in my opinion one of Gatsby's
strongest selling points.

But themes are hard to understand can leave beginners perplexed when they run
into difficult to grasp and hard to debug issues with themes. As the
[Theme API reference](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/theme-api/#theme-composition)
states, "themes at their core an algorithm that merges multiple gatsby-config.js
files together into a single config your site can use to build with". And to
understand how this algorithm works is crucial to circumnavigate those issues.

## Themes vs. plugins

Themes are [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins) (referred to as
plugins) that usualluy come with a
[`gatsby-config.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/)
and contain the string `gatsby-theme` in their name. Themes with a
`gatsby-config.js` are technically full featured Gatsby websites. They are
composable like any other plugin. You can add more than one theme to your
website. Themes are added just like plugins, i.e. you install a theme's NPM
package and add it with its config to the `plugins` array in your website's
`gatsby-config.js`.

## Theme composition

When you use multiple themes in your website, you compose them as **siblings**,
i.e. you list multiple themes in the `plugins` array in `gatsby-config.js`. Each
sibling theme's `gatsby-config.js` can reference additional themes in its
`plugins` array, which are called **parent** themes. This lets you create
complex recursive compositions.

Gatsby can have only one `gatsby-config.js`. Therefore, Gatsby needs to merge
all `gatsby-config.js` files that it finds in sibling and parent themes. The
[themes API reference](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/theme-api/#theme-composition)
explains that Gatsby merges `gatsby-config.js` files with a deep merge for
`siteMetadata` and `mapping`. This allows you to set defaults with a theme that
can be overridden in the website into which the theme is installed.

`gatsby-config.js` also contains a `plugins` array. There is no canonical way to
handle arrays in a deepmerge. Gatsby has its own way of merging plugins arrays
and I will walk you through how this works in the next section.

## Merging plugins arrays

Let's look at this
[`gatsby-config.js`](https://github.com/maiertech/coding-garden/blob/master/gatsby-config.js)
(from the repository with which I create the website that you are reading right
now) and merge all `gatsby-config.js` files as an example. In the example I
simplify some of the `gatsby-config.js` files.

Merging starts with the website's `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
// gatsby-config.js in website
// ...
plugins: ['@maiertech/gatsby-theme-digital-garden'],
// ...
```

Its `plugins` array is processed sequentially. If a plugin is a theme, its
`gatsby-config.js` needs to be merged recursively. In this case there is only
one plugin, but its a theme. Gatsby looks up its `gatsby-config.js` and starts a
recursion:

```js
// gatsby-config.js (simplified) in @maiertech/gatsby-theme-digital-garden
// ...
plugins: [
  // plugin 0
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core',
    options: {
      collection: 'posts',
      contentPath: 'content/posts',
    },
  },
  // plugin 1
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core',
    options: {
      collection: 'chunks',
      contentPath: 'content/chunks',
    },
  },
  // plugin 2
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-tags-core',
    options: {
      mdxCollections: ['posts', 'chunks'],
    },
  },
  // plugin 3
  'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
  // plugin 4
  'gatsby-plugin-image',
  // plugin 5
  '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-base',
  // plugin 6
  '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-theme-ui',
],
// ...
```

The `plugins` array contains 7 plugins, which are also processed sequentially.
Gatsby starts with plugin 0, which is a theme. This triggers another recursion
as Gatsby and looks up plugin 0's `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
// gatsby-config.js (simplified) of maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core.
// ...
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
    options: {
      name: collection,
      path: contentPath,
    },
  },
  'gatsby-plugin-sharp',
  'gatsby-transformer-sharp',
],
// ...
```

This plugins array does not contain any themes, which means that the recursion
ends with this merged `plugins` array for plugin 0:

```js
// merged plugins for plugin 0
[
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
    options: {
      name: 'posts',
      path: 'content/posts',
    },
  },
  'gatsby-plugin-sharp',
  'gatsby-transformer-sharp',
  // plugin 0 needs to be added as well
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core',
    options: {
      collection: 'posts',
      contentPath: 'content/posts',
    },
  },
],
```

The iteration of `plugins` in @maiertech/gatsby-themes-digital-garden continues
and next is plugin 1. Since plugin 1 is the same as plugin 0, we can skip the
details and go straight to the merged `plugins` array for plugin 1:

```js
// merged plugins for plugin 1
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
    options: {
      name: 'chunks',
      path: 'content/chunks',
    },
  },
  'gatsby-plugin-sharp',
  'gatsby-transformer-sharp',
  // plugin 1 needs to be added as well
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core',
    options: {
      collection: 'chunks',
      contentPath: 'content/chunks',
    },
  },
],
```

Back to the `plugins` array of @maiertech/gatsby-theme-digital-garden. Next is
plugin 2, which is a theme by name, but one without a `gatsby-config.js`.
Therefore, there is nothing to process and the merged `plugins` array for plugin
2 is this:

```js
// merged plugins for plugin 2
[
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-tags-core',
    options: {
      mdxCollections: ['posts', 'chunks'],
    },
  },
],
```

Back to `plugins` of @maiertech/gatsby-theme-digital-garden. Next are plugins 3
and 4, which are not themes, and therefore there is nothing to process:

```js
// merged plugins for plugin 3
plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-mdx'],
```

```js
// merged plugins for plugin 4
plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-image'],
```

Plugin 5 in the plugins array of @maiertech/gatsby-theme-digital-garden is a
theme and triggers a recursion. Gatsby looks up its `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
// gatsby-config.js of @maiertech/gatsby-theme-base.
// ...
plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-react-helmet', 'gatsby-plugin-sitemap'],
// ...
```

This `plugins` array contains two normal plugins and the recursion ends with
this merged `plugins` array:

```js
// merged plugins for plugin 5
plugins: [
  'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet',
  'gatsby-plugin-sitemap',
  // plugin 5 needs to be added as well
  '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-base',
],
```

The last plugin to process in `plugins` of @maiertech/gatsby-digital-garden is
plugin 6, which is a theme. Gatsby looks up its `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
// gatsby-config of @maiertech/gatsby-theme-theme-ui.
// ...
plugins: [
  'gatsby-plugin-catch-links',
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-theme-ui',
    options: { prismPreset: 'prism', preset: '@maiertech/preset' },
  },
],
// ...
```

There are no themese in this `plugins` array and the recursion ends with these
merged plugins:

```js
// merged plugins for plugin 6
plugins: [
  'gatsby-plugin-catch-links',
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-theme-ui',
    options: { prismPreset: 'prism', preset: '@maiertech/preset' },
  },
  // plugin 6 needs to be added as well
  '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-theme-ui',
],
```

Now we have 7 merged `plugins` arrays that need to be merged themselves. Gatsby
merges by concatenating arrays and removing duplicates. Two entries count as
duplicates when both their name and their options matches. Here is the merged
and deduplicated `plugins` array:

```js
plugins: [
  // Plugins that are commented out are deduplicated plugins.

  // Pugins from plugin 0.
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
    options: {
      name: 'posts',
      path: 'content/posts',
    },
  },
  'gatsby-plugin-sharp',
  'gatsby-transformer-sharp',
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core',
    options: {
      collection: 'posts',
      contentPath: 'content/posts',
    },
  },

  // Plugins from plugin 1.
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
    options: {
      name: 'chunks',
      path: 'content/chunks',
    },
  },
  // 'gatsby-plugin-sharp',
  // 'gatsby-transformer-sharp',
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core',
    options: {
      collection: 'chunks',
      contentPath: 'content/chunks',
    },
  },

  // Plugins from plugin 2.
  {
    resolve: '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-tags-core',
    options: {
      mdxCollections: ['posts', 'chunks'],
    },
  },

  // Plugins from plugin 3.
  'gatsby-plugin-mdx',

  // Plugins from plugin 4.
  'gatsby-plugin-image',

  // Plugins from plugin 5.
  'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet',
  'gatsby-plugin-sitemap',
  '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-base',

  // Plugins from plugin 6.
  'gatsby-plugin-catch-links',
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-theme-ui',
    options: { prismPreset: 'prism', preset: '@maiertech/preset' },
  },

  // Plugins from website.
  '@maiertech/gatsby-theme-digital-garden',
];
```

## Does the sequence in which plugins are defined matter?

The merged `plugins` array defines a sequence for plugins. And the question is:
do you have to be mindful as a developer in which sequence you define your
plugins? The anser is: it depends. Let's looks at some scnearios:

- **Overriding values of the
  [Gatsby config API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/):**
  since you have multiple `gatsby-config.js` files with potentially conflicting
  values, Gatsby consolidates these values with deep merges, as mentioned
  before. For deep merges the plugin sequence matters since subsequent configs
  are deepmerged into previous configs and take precedence. In other words: a
  config value defined further up in the `plugins` array can be overwritten by
  config values further down in the plugins array. This ensures that configs in
  your website take precedence over configs in your themes.
- **[Shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/):**
  Without going into any details about how shadowing in themes works, the
  sequence in which plugins are defined matters for shadowing. When a specific
  file is shadowed in multiple themes, shadowed files further down in the
  `plugins` array take precedence over shadowed files further up. Shadowed files
  in your website trump everything else.
- **[Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node):**
  Currently
  [Gatsby Node APIs of plugins run sequentially](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/28336)
  based on their sequence in `plugins`. Generally, the sequence in `plugins`
  should not matter in the sense that in above merged and deduplicated `plugins`
  array you could move `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to the top before all
  `gatsby-source-filesystem` entries without impact on the final website. This
  is because Gatsby Node API methods are desinged to respond to certain
  lifecycle events during the build, e.g. the most common method `onCreateNode`
  of the MDX plugin will run when a file node is created no matter where
  `gatsby-plugin-mdx` is located in the `plugins` array. That said, there may be
  plugins that consciously overwrite generated pages created earlier by other
  plugins. In this case sequence would matter, but the plugins README should
  point this out clearly.

## Key files to understand how this works

- How Gatsby processes all gatsby-config.js files from that it collects:
  https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/bootstrap/load-themes/index.js
- How Gatsby merges theme configs:
  https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/utils/merge-gatsby-config.ts

In this file there is a plugins array that contains
https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/a5210b2550b9646656aae28c28cb5be580cd5677/packages/gatsby/src/services/initialize.ts#L214

config => plugins with the consolidated plugins array

and themes which contains plugins and themes in the processed sequence but not
deduplicated. themes seems to have no purpose.

Then the journey continues to loadPlugins
