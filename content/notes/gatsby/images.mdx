[gatsby-plugin-image](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-image)
has been released and has now replaced
[gatsby-image](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-image).
The new API comes with `GatsbyImage` and `StaticImage`, which also supports
[remote URLs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v2.30/#support-remote-image-urls-experimental).
gatsby-plugin-image can be used with files or with providers to other image
services.

Gatsby was the first framework that made creating responsive images a breeze
with plugins
[`gatsby-plugin-sharp`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp)
and
[`gatsby-transformer-sharp`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp).
Querying image nodes triggers image processing and generation of metadata that
can be passed into `GatsbyImage`. The downside of this approach is that image
processing happens at build time, which puts a penalty on build duration.

Chris Biscardi says in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtIsCBrXluI)
that Gatsby's build process is 100% not the place to process images, because it
slows everything down. He says you need to have a separate process for image
processing, e.g. a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

## Cloudinary

Use Cloudinary with
[these plugins](https://cloudinary.com/blog/introducing_cloudinary_s_gatsby_plugins).
This transfers the pain of creating images in different sizes over to Cloudinary
and the transformer plugin can pull in cached processed images during the build
process. Check out these links:

## ImgIX

Use [imgIX](https://www.imgix.com/) with
[`@imgix/gatsby-transform-url`](https://github.com/imgix/gatsby/tree/main/packages/gatsby-transform-url).
Same approach as with Cloudinary.

## Cloudflare

Cloudflare also offers an
[image resizing service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/).

## Sanity

Santiy also offers image transformations.

## weserv.nl

https://images.weserv.nl/ is a transformation service. You bring your own image
stored somewhere else and let the service do transformations and caching.

## Other options

Instead of removing image processing from the build process you can also try to
optimize the build process:

- You can use [Gatsby cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) to accelerate
  builds. The first thing this does is it parallelizes image processing. The
  second thing it does it keeps Gatsby's cache around between builds. This
  reduces build times.
- You can
  [enable Gatsby incremental builds on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/23/enable-gatsby-incremental-builds-on-netlify/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=gatsby-perf-jl&utm_campaign=devex).
  This is poor man's Gatsby cloud. It keeps Gatsby's build cache around,
  avoiding having to reprocess all images on every build, but it does not
  parallelize image processing.
