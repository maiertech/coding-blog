There are some new developments for
[`gatsby-image`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-image).
Gatsby is in the process of replacing `gatsby-image` with
[`gatsby-plugin-image`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-image).

[StaticImage also supports remote URLs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v2.30/#support-remote-image-urls-experimental).

Gatsby was the first framework that made creating responsive images a breeze
with plugins
[`gatsby-plugin-sharp`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp)
and
[`gatsby-transformer-sharp`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp).
Querying image nodes would trigger image processing and generation of metadata
that could be passed into `Img` from
[`gatsby-image`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-image/) to create fixed
or fluid images. The big downside of this approach is that image processing
happens at build time, which puts a huge penalty on build duration. It's also
not great that image processing can only be griggered through GraphQL queries.

Chris Biscardi says in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtIsCBrXluI)
that Gatsby's build process is 100% not the place to process images, because it
slows you down. He says you need to have a separate process for image
processing, e.g., a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

There are two cloud-based solutions that remove image processing from the build
process:

- Use Cloudinary with
  [these plugins](https://cloudinary.com/blog/introducing_cloudinary_s_gatsby_plugins).
  This transfers the pain of creating images in different sizes over to
  Cloudinary and the transformer plugin can pull in cached processed images
  during the build process. This can get very expensive for popular sites, see
  this
  [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/spences10/status/1367824426964811776).
- Use [imgIX](https://www.imgix.com/) with
  [`@imgix/gatsby-transform-url`](https://github.com/imgix/gatsby/tree/main/packages/gatsby-transform-url).
  Same approach as for Cloudinary.
- Cloudflare also offers an image resizing service:
  https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/.
- Santiy also offers image transformations.
- https://images.weserv.nl/ is a transformation service. You bring your own
  image stored somewhere else and let the service do transformations and
  caching.

You need to be familiar with their APIs to make this work.d

Instead of removing image processing from the build process you can also try to
optimize the build process:

- You can use [Gatsby cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) to accelerate
  builds. The first thing this does is it parallelizes image processing. The
  second thing it does it keeps Gatsby's cache around between builds. This
  dramatically reduces build times.
- You can
  [enable Gatsby incremental builds on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/23/enable-gatsby-incremental-builds-on-netlify/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=gatsby-perf-jl&utm_campaign=devex).
  This is poor man's Gatsby cloud. It keeps Gatsby's build cache around,
  avoiding having to reprocess all images on every build, but it does not
  parallelize image processing.
