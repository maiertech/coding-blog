## Does it work with Codespaces?

Running the same debugging steps inside a codespace does not work. I summarized
my findings in
[this discussion](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/3536). This is
probably related to the fact that a codespace is a Docker container. Here are
some related GitHub issues:
