# Build

Chris Biscardi says in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtIsCBrXluI)
that Gatsby's build process is 100% not the place to process images, because it
slows you down. He says you need to have a separate process for this, e.g., a
service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
