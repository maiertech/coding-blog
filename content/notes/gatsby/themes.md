## Catalyst

Still need to vet [Catalyst](https://www.gatsbycatalyst.com/) to see if its good
quality.

## Courses

[gatsby-theme-courses](https://github.com/hangindev/gatsby-theme-courses): check
if this can be used as basis for a course platform.

## Doctocat

[Doctocat](https://github.com/primer/doctocat) is backed by GitHub and a pretty
polished theme that is suitable to document component libraries.

## Reflex

[Reflex](https://reflexjs.org/) is a collection og packages and Gatsby themes.
Awesome material to learn from.
