For my
[post about the files system route API](/posts/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-file-system-route-api-in-gatsby/),
I had a Gatsby site in mind that runs on MDX pages. For this use case the file
system route API was not an adequate repalcement for `gatsby-node.js` yet,
especially when using custom context to create pages.

I came across
[this theme](https://github.com/arshad/gatsby-theme-twentytwentyone/blob/master/src/styles/twentytwentyone.css)
which pulls data from WordPress and which uses the route API. It makes much more
sense in this example because you do not need to work with custom context
because you get all the data you need from WorPress.

Maybe I should update my post and mention this.
