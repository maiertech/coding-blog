## `npm` support

CodeSandbox does not support npm, but Yarn only.

## Renaming a sandbox

When you rename a sandbox from within the sandbox, this also changes the `name`
field in `package.json`. According to Codesandbox support, this is expected
behavior. They recommend using folders instead of renaming to organize
sandboxes.

Renaming a sandbox from the dashboard currently does not alter `package.json`.
Codesandbox support considers this to be a bug that they plan to fix. Therefore,
if you need to organize your sandboxes, use folders

## Conflict with Save to Pocket Chrome extension

The
[Save to Pocket](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj)
Chrome extension uses `⌘ ⇧ P` to activate. This conflicts with `⌘ ⇧ P` in
CodeSandbox. To deactivate `⌘ ⇧ P`, load extension's
[options](chrome-extension://niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj/options.html) in
Chrome and leave shortcut empty.
