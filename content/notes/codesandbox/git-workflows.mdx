Vercel's concept of
[immutable deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments)
redfines deployments as commodity that is meant to be used lavishly. Likewise,
Codesandbox redefines editors, such as a locallly installed
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as commodity that is meant to be used
lavishly. Condesandbox makes it easy to create, fork and discard sandboxes.
Lavish use of deployments or editors makes it possible to redefine traditionsl
workflows.

## GitHub view

Condesandbox's GitHub view is minimalistic. It features two buttons: `Commit`
and `Open PR`. At first glance, Codesandbox is missing branches. However, it
handles branches differently:

- You can create an immutable sandbox from any GitHub repository URL (including
  branch URLs) as described
  [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#import-from-github) or by using
  [githubbox.com](https://github.com/dferber90/githubbox).
- You can make this immutable sandbox editable by forking it. A fork maintains a
  link to the underlying GitHub repository URL.
- As mentioned
  [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/git#committing-and-opening-prs), a forked
  sandbox can be seen as a branch.

The `Commit` button commits all changes to the linked repository. The `Open PR`
creates a pull request that contains all commits since the sandbox was created
plus a commit containing all changes. This creates a new branch for the pull
request with the branch from which the sandbox was created as target. Your
sandbox then switches context to a new immutable sandbox created form this new
branch.

## Git workflows

### The no-branch workflow

- Create an immutable sandbox from `master`.
- Fork the sandbox to make it editable.
- If you have write permission to the linked repository, every commit goes to
  `master` and you might end up with unwanted commits on `master`.
- If you do not have write permission to the linked repository, you can still
  open a pull request that contains all changes.
- After you have created the pull request, you can discard your sandbox.

### The branch workflow

- Create an immutable sandbox from a branch.
- Fork the sandbox to make it editable.
- Commits go to the branch from which the sandbox was created.
- If you create a pull request on github.com (not using Codesandbox's `Open PR`
  button), then any subsequent commits also update the pull request.
- If you create a pull request with the `Open PR` button, Codesandbox creates a
  new branch for the pull request and your sandbox switches to the new branch.
  This is a potential pitfall since you would expect the pull request to be
  created from the branch from which you created the sandbox.

### Conclusions

The best workflow for repositories for which you have write permission is to
create a branch on github.com and then create a sandbox from that branch. In the
forked sandbox subsequent commits got to the same branch. The context switch and
creation of a new branch when using the `Open PR` button is confusing.
Therefore, it is better to create the pull requests on github.com.

For repositories for which you do not have write permission, using the `Open PR`
button works as expected and is convenient for random open source contributions.
