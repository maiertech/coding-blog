UMD modules are built in a way that they can run in a browser.

## What does unpkg do?

- It serves up npm packages.
- By default the file linked in `main` in `package.json`.
- E.g. https://unpkg.com/react redirects to
  https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.1/index.js.
- Go to https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.1/ to obtain a directory listing.
- You can locate the UMD build and the get the URL.
- You work with globals and include script tags that link to UMD builds on
  unpkg. This is as basic as it gets.
- Later on webpack said: let me create the script tags for you.
- You can still use webpack to bundle your app, but pull out react as separate
  script tag loaded from unpkg. The advantage would be that you don't force
  people to download react for every single page and instead allow them to use
  the cached version.

https://www.skypack.dev/ can be considered as the successor of UNPKG.
