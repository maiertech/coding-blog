We established that we would like to produce packages compliant with
Skypack.dev. The easiest way to achieve this is using

With [Microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) you can use
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) with having to become an expert in
configuring it. You get most of Rollup's benefits, such as tree shaking.

Microbundle supports multiple entry points for different distributions, eg.
`main` for CJS and `module` for the ESM. For ESM and CJS it bundles your code
but not dependencies. It also supports UMD with bundled dependencies.

## For CJS

It bundles the code into one file, but still uses `require` for dependencies.

## For ESM

It bundles the code into one file, but still uses `import` for dependencies.

- module: heavy Babel transpilation.
- modern: for new browsers only.

## For UMD

First question you need to ask: does it make sense to create UMD package, i.e.
should I run my package in the browser or not?

Or a better question is: should I use https://www.skypack.dev/ instead? Probably
yes, because everyone wants to use Snowpack and not deal with UNPKG.

## For Skypack.dev

We go with the recommendation for Skypack (Web and Node):

```
{
  "main": "./index-cjs.js",
  "module": "./index-esm.js",
  "exports": {
    "require": "./index-cjs.js",
    "import": "./index-esm.js"
  }
}
```

And for ESM we use modern.
