This posts gives an overivew of how CommonJS modules work.

[JavaScript Modules: From IIFEs to CommonJS to ES6 Modules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJWALEoGge4)

- Each file is a module by default.
- Anything exposed with `module.exports` can be imported using `require`. The
  `module` object is provided by Node.
- In general, the thing exposed is a function and there is only a single value
  exposed per module.
- You could also expose an object with multiple props. But the correct way to
  expose multiple things is via `exports`. The `exports` object is a reference
  to the `exports` prop on `module`.
- CommonJS modules are loaded synchronously and are therefore not suitable for
  browsers. Module bundlers can help make modules load asynchronously in
  browsers.
- In newer codebases you should not use `require` syntax. For
  [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) to work, bundlers
  analyze the static module structure of `import` and `export` statements.

## Dependencies

Dependencies need to be installed and are then required.
