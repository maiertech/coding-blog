There are multiple ways of using Theme UI:

1. On "normal" components using the JSX pragma to add the `sx` prop for styling.
   You can use scales and variants of the theme.
1. Use coherent styling via the `Styled` component which pulls styles from
   `theme.styles`.
1. Use `@theme-ui/components` to build and style components from atomic building
   blocks.
1. To use `theme.styles` as `components` in `MDXProvider` for MDX
   transformations.

Using Theme UI with MDX is a strong use case, but its optional.
