I don't understand why [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is
[so polarizing](https://dev.to/jaredcwhite/why-tailwind-isn-t-for-me-5c90). Some
developers are very vocal about it and reject the idea of using utility classes
for styling. Controversy aside, the company behind Tailwind CSS, Tailwind Labs,
was bootstrapped by [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/) from zero employees to
four employees without any VC money. You probably could not make a safer choice
for a styling solution in terms of financial stability. There is no strong
dependency on a single contributor or a community of contributors and no risk of
VC money not returning profits fast enough.

## Why utility classes?

I probably should read these articles start to finish:

- https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/
- https://johnpolacek.github.io/the-case-for-atomic-css/
- https://frontstuff.io/in-defense-of-utility-first-css

Use pre-defined hyper composable utility classesinstead of custom classes. You
can use
[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
to access all generated utility classes.

## What is so compelling about Tailwind CSS?

- Seeing other developers re-build websites with Tailwind CSS in no time.
- The promise of eliminating the CSS-in-JS layer in my stack.
- The promise to go back to bare CSS.
- Comes with theming and scales.
- The promise of playing nicely with React components for abstractions.
- The hope that it will unleash my design creativity.

## What puts me off?

- Tailwind CSS does not come with any components, because they are spinned off
  to commercail [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/). Tailwind UI components
  cannot be re-packaged and distributed as a component library.
- [Optimizing for production](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production)
  is a hassle and requires stripping out unused utility classes with regular
  expressions.
- Some developers frown upon Tailwind CSS because it allegedly pollutes HTML
  with utility classes.

## How to not abstract

This is a summary of the article
[Building React Components using Tailwind](https://tilomitra.com/building-react-components-using-tailwind/).
Using Tailwind CSS with React means using Tailwind's utility classes with the
`className` prop:

```js
className =
  'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded';
```

You could just use Reacts's standard HTML elements and slab on utility classes.
DX would be pretty close to using Tailwind in a static HTML project. To improve
component APIs, you can use the `classnames` package. In this example component
props are mapped to utility classes and processed with `classnames`:

```jsx
function Button ({size, bgColor, textColor, children}) {
  return (
    <button className={classnames(`bg-${bgColor} text-${textColor} font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`, {
      "text-xs": size === 'sm'
      "text-xl": size === 'lg',
    })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
};
```

But this approach should be avoided because it makes purging utility classes
impossible because you cannot match regular expressions any more.
[Purging utility classes is required to eliminate all unused utility classes from the generated global CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production).

You can abstract in two basic ways:

- Define a theme (not a Tailwind theme) as JavaScript object with constants that
  represent a composition of utility classes. You can use these constants
  similar to variants in Theme UI or mixins in Sass. You can maintain the theme
  in its own package and share it across projects.
- You can use Tailwind's `@apply` directive to abstract utility classes. This
  makes sense for atomic components like buttons, but has less value for complex
  components. More complex components come with a more complex HTML structure
  and it is not enough to abstract styles only. Tailwind's [own
  course}(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5f_mz_zU5eXWYDXHUDOLBE0scnuJofO0)
  says that you should rather not use `@apply` to abstract classes.

Basic abstraction might be an option when you work in a basic HTML and CSS
project. At this point you probably want to reach for reusable components or
template partials, because they can abstract both, HTML structure and styles.
Rather than using `@apply` to abstract CSS classes, you should abstract entire
components that are styled with utility classes. React and Vue are two ways to
abstract structure, styles and behavior in components.

## Is Tailwind CSS suitable to build a React component library?

At this point we know that React components are a great way to abstract Tailwind
styling. We can looks at many examples of websites using Tailwind CSS to style
React components. But the question is: can we use Tailwind CSS to create a react
component library?

This question revolves around the problem of having to purge unused utility
classes for production. When components live in a component library this turns
into a tricky problem, because the purge step assumes that you can access all
utility classes in your local repository. This is not the case when some
components are imported from an NPM package.

I could not find any React component libraries that are styled with Tailwind CSS
only. [Nature UI](https://nature-ui.com/) claims to use Tailwind CSS, but I have
not understood why it would make sense to combine
[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and Tailwind CSS, which is what
it does.

In Tailwinds new video course, they mention that PurgeCSS uses the
[concept of safelisting](https://purgecss.com/safelisting.html) to prevent
certain utility classes from being deleted. With safelisting you could create
safelists inside a component library, export them and import them into the site
for processing. This would need to be done on a per component basis. I
[asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/maiertech/status/1361936504587759618) if
there is a best practice to do this. Pointers I received:

- Moving forward,
  [this discussion](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/3267)
  can be used to watch this space.
- [This tweet](https://twitter.com/benfooben/status/1361993039196139520)
  suggests to include a path to a CSS file located in `node_modules` and provide
  it to PurgeCSS. Predictable paths might be a problem when packages get hoisted
  by Yarn.
- I googled
  [this gist](https://gist.github.com/somebody32/48277662e55dd450d542724bc989c62d),
  which features some code of how to make this work.
- Add a safelist to a [preset](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets) and import
  it.

That all being said, it looks like styling a component library with Tailwind CSS
is hard at the moment, because there is no good way to integrate it with
PurgeCSS. I am not sure if I want to be the one solving this problem in my
design system.

But maybe this problem is not meant to be solved because there is a better
option out there: unstyled components. Tailwind are working on
[Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/), a component library of unstyled
components that can be styled with Tailwind CSS. Another player in this space is
[Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/), which has more components and is more mature.

The solution:

- https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro

This is a way to add constraints to styled-components without going the
styled-system route.

## PostCSS

[`tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss) is a
[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) plugin. You can compose and customize the parts
from Tailwind you want to use and compile it into the final CSS file with
PostCSS.

**Tailwind does not include any JavaScript.**

## Examples

[swr.vercel.app](https://github.com/vercel/swr-site) is built with Tailwind CSS.
Custom components use utility classes. The project contains a Tailwind config
that includes a `purge` prop. This triggers Tailwind to purge unused utility
classes from the styles.

This project is done with [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra), which a
simple docus generator based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Tailwind CSS.

## Does Tailwind CSS work with...?

### Gatsby

Yes! Configure the PostCSS chain with
[`gatsby-plugin-postcss`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-postcss/)
and then import the compiled CSS file in your `gatsby-browser.js` as global CSS.
See
[Tailwind and Gatsby](https://hashinteractive.com/blog/tailwind-css-and-gatsby-in-under-5-minutes/)
article.

### Styled System/Theme UI

No! I think a Styled System/Theme UI approach is fundamentally incompatible with
utility classes. Tailwind's philosophy is to define a ton of utility classes
from which you use only a few to build your actual site. Theme UI's philosophy
is to choose a theme with some predefined scales and then use this theme style
components. You do not have to write a lot of custom CSS because you try to
stick with what is defined in your theme. The little custom CSS you need to
write you can write without any framework.

### Styled Components

I don't see why you would try to combine Tailwind CSS with Styled Components.
Styled components gives you scoped CSS by abstracting away classes. Adding a
desing system to Styled Components gives you Styled System.
