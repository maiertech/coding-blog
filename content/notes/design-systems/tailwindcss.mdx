The reason why I'm looking into Tailwind CSS is because I find it hard to wrap
my head around [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/home). For many legacy
applications rewriting them with Theme UI is not an option.

I would like to have method of styling that works in both worlds, legacy
websites and modern React apps. Ideally, it should rely on a single source of
truth for styling. It is not clear if such a solution is technically feasible.
In this note I explore if [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) can be used
to build such a solution.

## A case for utility classes

## PostCSS

[`tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss) is a
[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) plugin. You can compose and customize the parts
from Tailwind you want to use and compile it into the final CSS file with
PostCSS.

**Tailwind does not include any JavaScript.**

## Utility-first workflow

Use pre-defined utility classes instead of writing custom classes. You can use
[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
to access all utility classes. Using utility classes makes it very easy to
create styles, but it comes with the downside that the resulting code is
polluted with dozens of global class names.

## Gatsby

You can use Tailwind CSS with Gatsby. Configure the PostCSS chain with
[`gatsby-plugin-postcss`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-postcss/)
and then import the compiled CSS file in your `gatsby-browser.js` as global CSS.
See
[Tailwind and Gatsby](https://hashinteractive.com/blog/tailwind-css-and-gatsby-in-under-5-minutes/)
article.

## Theme UI

If you like the Tailwind's utility-first workflow, do not use Theme UI. The
utility-first workflow is incompatible with Theme UI's component-driven and
styling-via-props approach.

If you like Tailwind's design-system, i.e., space scales, breakpoints etc. you
can use
[`@theme-ui/preset-tailwind`](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/tree/master/packages/preset-tailwind).
This preset mimicks Tailwind's design system in a theme, which you can use like
any other Theme UI theme. But there is no PostCSS compile chain anywhere. The
`tailwindcss` package is not even a dependency. See
[How to Use Theme UI Tailwind CSS Preset](https://hashinteractive.com/blog/how-to-use-theme-ui-tailwind-css-preset/)
article.

Tailwind's philosophy is to define a ton of utility classes from which you use
only a few to build your actual site. On the other hand, Theme UI's philosophy
is to choose a theme with some predefined scales and then use them to create
your components. You do not have to write a lot of custom CSS because you try to
stick with what is defined in your theme and the little custom CSS you need to
write you can write without any framework.

## Building reusable components with Tailwind

This is a summary of the article
[Building Reusable React Components Using Tailwind](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/reusable-react-components-tailwind/).Using
Tailwind CSS with React means using Tailwind's utility classes with the
`className` prop:

```js
className =
  'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded';
```

You could just use Reacts's standard HTML elements and slab on utility classes.
DX would be pretty close to using Tailwind in a static HTML project. To improve
component APIs, you can use the `classnames` package. In this example component
props are mapped to utility classes and processed with `classnames`:

```jsx
function Button ({size, bgColor, textColor, children}) {
  return (
    <button className={classnames("bg-${bgColor} text-${textColor} font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded", {
      "text-xs": size === 'sm'
      "text-xl": size === 'lg',
    })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
};
```

This combination of React's `className` prop with the `classnames` embraces
Tailwind's utility classes without adding any custom CSS classes. The downside
is that you have to rely on a global stylesheet with tons of utility classes,
most of which you never use. Tailwind provides
[ways to remove unused classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/).

You can abstract in two ways:

- Define a theme as JavaScript object (not a Tailwind theme) with constants that
  represent a composition of utility classes. You can use these constants
  similar to variants in Theme UI or mixins in Sass and butcher the utility
  classes into the `className` prop in one way or another. You can maintain the
  theme in its own package and share it across projects.
- You can use Tailwind's `@apply` directive to abstract utility classes. This
  makes sense for atomic components like buttons, but has less value for complex
  components. More complex components come with a more complex HTML structure
  and it is not enough to abstract styles only.

At this point you probably want to reach for reusable components or template
partials, because they can abstract both, HTML structure and styles. Rather than
using `@apply` to abstract CSS classes, you should abstract entire components
that are styled with utility classes. React and Vue are two ways to abstract
structure, styles and behavior in components.

This is not something you can achieve in a project with plain HTML and CSS. In
this case your only option is copy paste structure. If you stack uses a template
engine, you can use template partials to abstract components.

But don't forget that no matter which abstraction you choose you still rely on
global styles. This means that your React components are not self contained.

## Examples

[swr.vercel.app](https://github.com/vercel/swr-site) is built with Tailwind CSS.
Custom components use utility classes. The project contains a Tailwind config
that includes a `purge` prop. This triggers Tailwind to purge unused utility
classes from the styles.

This project is done with [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra), which a
simple docus generator based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Tailwind CSS.
