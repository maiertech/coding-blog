I have created my own tiny design system https://design-system.maier.tech/. It
is build with [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/), which is a brainchild of
[Styled System](https://styled-system.com/).

Theme UI was supposed to get a lot of Gatsby love, but then the creator stopped
maintaining the project and the project is now in limbo. See this discussion on
GitHub: https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/discussions/1354. The project is
still maintained but contributions are rather thin. Therefore, I am looking for
an alterantive technology to continue with my design system.

## Where we started

Styled Components bring scoped CSS to the table and theming to the table. But it
does not provide a way to use design tokens. Styled System was a way to add
design tokens and mobile first design to Styled Components and Emotion.

Theme UI was the latest iteration of this approach and it added some MDX support
(which made it more complicated).

## Chakra UI

Theme UI is very opinionated about styling. It uses the
[Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) approach and does not have room for
any other styling approaches. Unfortunately, the
[Styled System repository](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system) is in
the same state of low maintenance as Theme UI.

Chakra UI has embraced Styled System and they have absorbed some of the core
features of Styled System. They made the wrong bet, but they took ownership to
not let their library go to waste. Chakra UI's repo is very active with the
caveat that the most active contributor by far is the original creator. If he
pulled out, the library might see the same fate as Theme UI.

But a strong argument for short term adoption is Chakra's component library of
lego brick components and that it will probably be the least disruptive option.
You can think of adopting Chakra UI as band aid, with an option that it will
also be a longer term fix if the wound heals properly.

## Tailwind CSS

There is so much hotness and hype around Tailwind CSS. Almost too much. Let's
start with some downsides:

- Tailwind CSS does not come with any components. Because it's components are
  the commercial spin-off [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/). And none of
  these components can be packaged and distributed in a design system.
- [Optimizing for production](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production)
  is a hassle in Tailwind and involves stripping utility classes based on
  regular expressions. For a component library
  [this gets messy and involved](https://gist.github.com/somebody32/48277662e55dd450d542724bc989c62d).

But Tailwind CSS also makes a case for styling being just a very thin and
lightweight layer that can be swapped for some other styling technology. Their
[Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) suggests that components should probably
be put in a library without styling and then be styled in the site only.
Headless UI is very early and I am not sure if I want to rely on it already.

## Stitches and Radix

You can think of [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) as a variation of the Styled
Systems approach and it includes support for design tokens. But it does not use
Styled System as a dependency and differs in syntax. You can use Stitches to
style unstyled [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/). You can use anything
for styling, including Tailwind CSS, but the preferred way is Stitches.

Even though this is bleeding edge, the Stitches and Radix combo is a serious
contender, especially should I be tempted to go for Chakra UI.
