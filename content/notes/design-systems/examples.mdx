## Built with CSS

- [Tailwind CSS](/notes/design-systems/tailwind)
- [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/)

## Modulz

- [Radix](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction) is a
  library with unstyled primitives that can be styled using anything.
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) is a CSS-in-JS library that works really
  well with Radix.
- [Modulz Design System](https://github.com/modulz/design-system): putting it
  all together.

## Built with Styled System

Unfortunately, styled-system is dead. Yet it lives on in different forms.

- [Palette (by Artsy)](https://github.com/artsy/palette)
- [Radius (by Rangle)](https://github.com/rangle/radius)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/): They pulled the styled-system core into
  their own codebase. This is probably the framework to reach for if you would
  have reached for Theme UI in the past.
- [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/): Pretty much dead, kept alive by a small
  community and no Gatsby support unfortunately.

### Reflex

On 18 June 2020 [archadcn](https://twitter.com/arshadcn) dropped
[Reflex](https://reflexjs.org/). This is a design system for Gatsby, a
collection packages and Gatsby themes that use Theme UI under the hood.

At the center is a component library with atoms named after HTML tags. Styling
is done via props, but the syntax is custom and deviates from Styled System. He
uses these components to build more complex blocks.

Prior art is his
[gatsby-theme-flex](https://github.com/arshad/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-flex)
in which he allows creating blocks inside Markdown files. This project relies
heavily on shadowing.
