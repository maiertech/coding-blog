- What is the benefit of CSS-in-JS? Mostly scoped CSS.
  - Styled components was the first prominent tool, Emotion followed with less
    overhead. In both libraries you are still using CSS.
  - Styled-system added an abstraction layer on top that added support for
    themeing and made mobile first development easier. This was a significant
    step to go from a styling solution to a framework to build design systems.
  - Out of Styled System evovled Theme UI and added a default component mapping
    for MDX (also a weak point) components and the `sx` prop. This was supposed
    to be the default way of styling for Gatsby. Theme UI was the first
    CSS-in-JS solution where I started to notice the pain of using it.
  - But then the author took a hiatus from both and both libraries went into the
    unmaintained state.
  - Styled system lived on in Chakra UI and preserved its ideas.
  - What does mOdulz bring to the table?
- Another way of avoiding the pitfalls of unscoped CSS was using utility
  classes. Always frowed upon because it adds a lot of classses, it just avoids
  unscoped CSS as long as you are disciplined enough to stick with utility
  classes. It got some traction when it was used in conjunction with Next.js in
  2020 and Tailwind make a very strong case for utility classes. People started
  realizing that they can have the benefits of a design system (thanks to CSS
  variables) and avoid the overhead of CSS-in-JS.
