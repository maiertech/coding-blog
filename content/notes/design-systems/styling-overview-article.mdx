CSS implements 3 basic concepts:

1. **Cascade:**: When 2 rules with equal specificity apply, the last one wins.
1. **Specificity:** A browsers uses specificity to decide which rules apply.
1. **Inheritance:** In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is
   specified for a property on an element.

Understanding cascade and inheritance are much easier than understanding
specificity. Usually it is specificyt that trips you when writing CSS.

## Level 0: Vanilla CSS

Use CSS without any convention.

- Sooner than later specificity trips you.
- No consistency in terms of spacing and colors.

Varaiations: with Sass or CSS variables for more consistency.

## Level 1: Semantic CSS

Use semantic classnames (e.g. `.author-bio`). This means that every CSS rule you
write starts with a semantic classname. This creates a scope that shields
different blocks of CSS from each other.

HTML is restylable, but CSS is not reusable:

- HTML is semantic and independent of CSS.
- You can restyle without touching HTML.
- CSS is very dependent on HTML and is hard to reuse.

## Level 2: BEM

Use more semantic classnames. Each element gets a semantic class name and the
classnames follow a naming convention.

HTML is restylable, but CSS is still not reusable:

- HTML is still semantic and independent of CSS.
- CSS is now also independent of HTML.
- Reusing a semantic class outside its semantic context is difficult.

## Level 3: Bootstrap

Use content-agnostic CSS components, e.g. `.badge`, `.btn`. One class goes on
one element. Introduces the concept of composition, e.g. `.btn .btn-primary`.
These classes are implemented with Sass variables, not utility classes.

CSS is resusable, but HTML is not restylable.

Bootstrap is not a design system, because when you manually rewrite a class you

Bootstrap 5 is adding a utilities API, which is a Sass-based tool to generate
utility classes.

## Level 4: Utility first

Maximize reusabiity. We have already given up on restylability. With this
approach you never write CSS again. And as a side effect you can enforce
consistency, which is required for a design-system.

The idea is to build abstractions with React components, not with classnames.

Tailwind uses PostCSS to generate utility classes.

- Start by looking at https://2020.stateofcss.com/.

Technologies to look at:

- Semantic CSS
- PostCSS (post processor category)
- Tailwind CSS (CSS frameworks category)
- Bootstrap (primarily to make a case why not to use it)
- BEM (naming convention on top of standard CSS)
- Styled Components (CSS-in-JS)

This article
https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/ shows how
semantic CSS was supposed to separate markup and styling. But actually the CSS
closely followed the structure of the markup.

To solve this problem, BEM was suggested as solution. Add more classes with a
disciplined naming convention.

A lot of things that you would have done with a CSS framework in the past, such
as creating a grid, can now be done with CSS, using Flexbox and CSS Grid.
Anything layout should now be done with standard CSS. This shifts what added
value a styling solution should provide.

The big benefit of CSS-in-JS is that it creates scoped CSS by default, which
allows us packaging styles with components. This is great for the component
paradigm. The other benefit is that you can make styling dynamic with
JavaScript.

Other styling solutions also try to unscoped CSS. E.g. BEM bets on discipline to
avoid leaking styles. To make styling easier (in terms of less micro decision to
be made) and more consistent,

There is still another challenge: design systems. How can we get things more
consistent and coherent in terms of spacing and colors etc.

## Remarks

- Styled components was the first prominent tool, Emotion followed with less
  overhead. In both libraries you are still using CSS.
- Styled-system added an abstraction layer on top that added support for
  themeing and made mobile first development easier. This was a significant step
  to go from a styling solution to a framework to build design systems.
- Out of Styled System evovled Theme UI and added a default component mapping
  for MDX (also a weak point) components and the `sx` prop. This was supposed to
  be the default way of styling for Gatsby. Theme UI was the first CSS-in-JS
  solution where I started to notice the pain of using it.
- But then the author took a hiatus from both and both libraries went into the
  unmaintained state.
- Styled system lived on in Chakra UI and preserved its ideas.
- What does mOdulz bring to the table?
- Another way of avoiding the pitfalls of unscoped CSS was using utility
  classes. Always frowed upon because it adds a lot of classses, it just avoids
  unscoped CSS as long as you are disciplined enough to stick with utility
  classes. It got some traction when it was used in conjunction with Next.js in
  2020 and Tailwind make a very strong case for utility classes. People started
  realizing that they can have the benefits of a design system (thanks to CSS
  variables) and avoid the overhead of CSS-in-JS.
