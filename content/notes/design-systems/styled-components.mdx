Styled components is a battle tested styling option. What it lacks is support
for design tokens. It comes with a `ThemeProvider` component for theming. Pedro
Duarte calls this approach a legacy approach in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw28VgyKGkw).

The `ThemeProvider` is actually completely optional. You can add design tokens
with CSS variables. This gives you the best of CSS and you still get scoped CSS.
It really should be possible to pull off styling with styled components and
adding design tokens with CSS variables.

[Wes Bos's Gatsby site](https://github.com/wesbos/wesbos) uses styled component
combined with CSS variables. He has only a few design tokens as global CSS
variables and stays as barebone CSS as possible.

One caveat is that styled components do not support variants. The question is:
do I really need them? My previous solution was to patch something like Styled
System on top, which is bad for performance.

A solution like [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) is a true CSS-in-JS solution
that adds better support for design tokens and a nicer syntax that supports
variants. But is it worth betting on Stitches, or is it better to got with
styled components?
