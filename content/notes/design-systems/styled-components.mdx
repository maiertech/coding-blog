Styled components is a mature styling option. What it lacks is support for
design tokens.

Its `ThemeProvider` is completely optional. It's a legacy approach to add design
tokens. But we can add design tokens with CSS variables, then we do not need a
ThemeProvider and we still get the benefit of scoped CSS.

It really should be possible to pull off styling with styled components and
adding design tokens with CSS variables.

Variants are als supported.

Wes Bos's Gatsby site uses styled components and stays as barebones CSS as
possible. He has a few design tokens in his global CSS.

The question is: would Stitches add any value in a styled components minus
ThemeProvider scenario?
