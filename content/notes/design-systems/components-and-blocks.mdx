Libraries with atomic components such as `@theme-ui/components` seem to be the
correct level on which to share components.

I added more complex components to my `@maiertech/components` and noticed that
their API can get complicated rather quickly. `Header` and `Footer` are good
examples. Such components are tightly coupled to the data they represent, for a
header it could be a multi-leve navigation.

Blocks are complex pieces of layout composed of reusable components. Blocks are
not from a component library because their API would be way too complicated.
Blocks are technically not reusable in the sense of a component library that can
be updated any time with changes.

Rather they live closer to where the data which they consume resides. For
example, they live in a Gatsby theme or a site. You could maintain sample blocks
in the docs from where the sample can be copied. It is usually followed by heavy
custmization.

Customization for `@maiertech/components` is done with variants that allow
changing parts of a component. Composing component happens inside the library
and variants can be applied to customize.

Another approach is composing atoms outside the library. A component which would
have a somewaht complicated API, such as a Dropdown with options, is split up
into atomic components that have to be composed to make something useful. Each
atom can have a not too complicated API. The total adds up to powerful
customizations.
