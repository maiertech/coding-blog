If you write a normal app you normally want to be able to import MDX files and
have them processed on the fly:

- For Parcel there is
  [`@mdx-js/parcel-plugin-mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/parcel).
- For Webpack there is
  [`@mdx-js/loader`](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/webpack).

## Gatsby

See [here](/notes/gatsby/gatsby-plugin-mdx).

## Next.js

## Importing MDX files

When you import an MDX file, no matter with which bundler or framework, this
results in a component that you can use like any other react component. This MDX
component takes a `components` prop that you can use to customize the
transformation from MDX to JSX. `components` basically maps standard HTML
elements to React components that are used for rendering instead of the standard
elements.

This feature is enabled by the
[`mdx-loader`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/loaders/mdx-loader.js)
of
[`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx).
`mdx-loader` is a Webpack plugin that converts an MDX file into a React
component.

You can import another MDX file into an MDX file and use it as if it were a
component:

```
import AnotherFile from './another-file.mdx'

<AnotherFile />
```

You can even pass props into the imported MDX file component:

```
<AnotherFile title="Hello World!" />
```

And use access the props like this:

```
// another-file.mdx

# {props.title}

Some text.
```

You can export data from `another-file.mdx` and access it inside its parent (the
file that imports `another-file.mdx`).

```
// another-file.mdx

# Heading

Some text.

export const data someData = { key: 'value' }
```

In the parent file you can do this import:

```
import AnotherFile, { someData } from './another-file.mdx'

{someData.key}
```

## MDXProvider and global layout

Instead of providing `components` to each MDX component, you can use
`MDXProvider` to make a `components` mapping availalbe to MDX components via
context. You can place `MDXProvider` in your `App.js` somewhere pretty high up
in your component tree.

The `components` prop can contain a special component referred to as `wrapper`.
You can use it to apply a layout or manipulate wrapped components. The `wrapper`
receives `children` as props. You can then filter the children, e.g. select all
`h1` elements to create a table of contents. Or you just wrap everything with a
layout. See https://github.com/pomber/the-x-in-mdx.

Note that `components`
[needs to be defined as a constant and not inline](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/components#mdxprovider).

If you nest `MDXProvider`, the component contexts are merged,
[unless you use the functional form to override the merge](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v1#mdxprovider).

## Layouts

You can use the default export in an MDX file to define a layout that overrides
the wrapper. A layout is a component that takes a `children` prop and wraps the
MDX content.
