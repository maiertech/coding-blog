[This table](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#table-of-components) shows the
default mapping between Markdown syntax and React components.

With Theme UI `theme.styles` is used for `components` in `MDXProvider`. Anything
not defined in `theme.styles` results in the default mapping with classname
`css-0`. Not clear if that classname is coming from Theme UI or MDX.
