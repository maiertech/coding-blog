# Online course examples

This is a list of paid online courses created and marketed by individual
creators. This list focuses on courses that follow the Wes Bos model, i.e. a mix
of free and paid content, but no subscriptions.

For video hosting Scott Tolinski recommends [Mux](https://mux.com/) and Wes Bos
recommends [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/).

## React Security

[ReactSecurity](https://reactsecurity.io/) by
[Ryan Chenkie](https://ryanchenkie.com/) focuses on how to get the security of
React applications right. He has a free teaser course
[React Security Fundamentals](https://courses.reactsecurity.io/courses/react-security-fundamentals)
which uses CodeSandbox for content delivery. The free course leads up to his
paid course
[Advanced React Security Patterns](https://reactsecurity.io/advanced-react-security-patterns/).
His teaser videos are on YouTube and his course videos are hosted on Wistia.
Ryan is also running [angularcasts](https://angularcasts.io/), a subscription
based service.

## Wes Bos

[Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) offers a mix of free and paid courses. He is the
gold standard for self marketed online courses.

Videos are hosted on Vimeo and are not protected. They are essentially unlisted.
What you pay for is the experience of his course app and the privilege to
download videos.

He is selling via Stripe directly and also offers PayPal. He mentioned in his
Podcast that PayPal is an important sales channel that he does not want to miss
out.

List price: 139$, discounted price: 59$.

## Lee Robinson

[Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/) is new to the game and currenlty marketing
his course [Mastering Next.js](https://masteringnextjs.com/). The course is free
since beginning of July, Vercel probably sponsored him.

Lengthy videos and high resolution screencast make it hard to watch.

He uses [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) for his newsletter, but this has
an agressive input validation that rejects my custom email addresses.

## Chris on Code

Wes Bos style courses: https://makereactapps.com/. Many short videos with high
production quality. Hosts his [course platform](https://learn.chrisoncode.io/)
on [Podia](https://www.podia.com/), which is Wes Bos as a service.

## Umar Hansa

Umar is the Google DevTool guru. He covers a unique niche with developer tips on
Twitter. His course [Modern DevTools](https://moderndevtools.com/) is quite
unique because it does not require any coding.

List price: 153$, discounted: 89$.
