## Permissions

Screenflow needs the following permissions in **System Preferences → Security &
Privacy**:

- Camera
- Microphone
- Screen Recording
- Accessibility (optional for keystroke recording)

## Microphone calibration

In **System Preferences → Sound → Input**, choose your microphone and put input
volume to 50%. Move volume up while talking until input level reaches
consistently 75%.

Record a microphone test with audio only. The levels of the track should fill
50% to 2/3 of the track. You can fine tune your microphone settings in the new
recording dialog. But you should first adjsut the settings st system level plus
microphone gain, if applicable and only then fine tune in Screenflow.

## Define recording area

You can define a recording area in new recording dialog. Screenflow records the
actual retina pixels (HiDPI mode), which results in very crisp video. You can
verify your effective resolution in **File → Document Settings...**.
