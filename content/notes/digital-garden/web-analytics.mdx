I am looking for a privacy friendly web anaytics solution. Google Analytics it a
no go.

## Fathom analytics

[Fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/) is an easy to setup privacy friendly
solution. I will write a chunk on how to set it up for a Gatsby website. The big
pro is that you can host the tracking script from you own domain and it will
therefore practically not get blocked. The downside is the cost of 14$, which is
justifiable if you make money from your site, but which is too much for
side-projects. But since Cloudflare Web Analytics does not support single page
apps, Fathom is currently the only option.

## Cloudflare Web Analytics

[Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052685432-Cloudflare-Web-Analytics)
is a free alternative to Google Analytics, but privacy friendly. The tracking
script cannot be hosted from a custom domain and is therefore more prone to
getting blocked. You do not have to route your website through Cloudflare to use
the free analytics prodcut.

The documentation states that you can only add one website to Cloudflare Web
Analytics. This has changed recently and you can now add multiple web
properties. However,
[Cloudflare Web Analytics does not support single page apps as of December 2020](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/web-analytics-with-progressive-web-site-gatsby-js/229068).

## Splitbee

[Splitbee](https://splitbee.io/) is a new analytics service and competitor to
Fathom Analytics. The documentation on single page apps and Gatsby is non
existent. But their [Next.js Proxy](https://splitbee.io/docs/nextjs-proxy) seems
to be worth looking into when workign with Next.js.
