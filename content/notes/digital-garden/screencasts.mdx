## Screen recording

- [Quicktime](/notes/digital-garden/quicktime) is already on your Mac and you
  can start recording immediatley. It seems a bit too simple for even basic use
  cases.
- [ScreenFlow](/notes/digital-garden/screenflow) seems to be the most commonly
  recommended tool, despite all its limitaions and bugs. It can do video editing
  as well, which is a strong selling point.
- The new cool kid on the block is [Descript](https://www.descript.com/). It's
  approach of transcribing the recording and then letting you work in the
  transcription maked video editing much easier than with ScreenFlow.

## Microphone calibration

In system preferences => Sound => Input, choose your microphone and put input
volume to 50%. Move volume up while talking until input level reaches
consistently 75%.

If you maxed the input volume at the OS level but it is not high enough, you can
still try to bumo it up in your screen recording software.

## Preparing your desktop

Your goal is to record at 1920 x 1080 (full HD). This is a 16:9 ratio. If you
have the pixels, you should try recording at double the resolution.

If you record on a Mac, you should record at the widest resolution that is 16:9.
For example, a Macbook Air's default resolution is 1440 x 900 widest 16:9
resolution that fits on the screen is 1440 x 810. For its scaled up 1680 x 1050
resolution the wides 16:9 resolution is 1680 x 945.

I use [BetterSnapTool](https://folivora.ai/bettersnaptool) to define a snap area
that resizes a window to 1440 x 810 and snaps it to the top of the screen.
