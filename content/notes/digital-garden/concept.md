# Concept

The term digital garden was coined by
[Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) and a
prominent early adopter is [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
from [Egghead](https://egghead.io/).

## Principles for my digital garden

- My digital garden is a tool to learn in public and to help me
  [switch gears](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learning-gears/).
- The ultimate goal is to
  [switch from consumer to creator](https://nathanbarry.com/consumer-to-creator/).
- Implement with Gatsby, since I have invested heavily into Gatsby for work.
- Mobile first design.
- Content is stored in MDX files in a GitHub repo, no CMS.
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or
  [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) workflow for content
  updates.
- Support for self hosted images.
- Support for YouTube videos.
