## Software

### Screencasts

- [Quicktime](/notes/digital-garden/quicktime) is already on your Mac and you
  can start recording immediatley. It seems a bit too simple for even basic use
  cases.
- Despite all its limitaions and bugs, there seems to be consensus that
  [ScreenFlow](/notes/digital-garden/screenflow) is the way to go.

There is a
[Screenflow training on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/screenflow-8-essential-training/customizing-your-keyboard-shortcuts?u=70939946).

### Streaming

- De facto standard: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (open source). My first
  impression was: too complex, but maybe I'm wrong.
- [Ecamm Live](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/) seems a more polished
  option and if you are serious about streaming the monthly subscription fee is
  probably worth paying for less hassle.

### Window managers

## Camera

Everyone recommends
[Elgato Cam Link 4K](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link-4k), which
normally costs around
130$. This helps you get a clean HDMI stream from a
supported camera. During the COVID-19 pandemic this device has been sold out
retailed for about 300$.

Somewhat hidden on the
[Cam Link 4K's video conferencing page](https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041358791-Cam-Link-4K-Video-Conferencing#:~:text=The%20Elgato%20Game%20Capture%20HD60%20S%2B%20features%20up%20to%204K60,compatible%20with%20video%20conferencing%20software.)
it is mentioned that the
[Elgato HD60 S+](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/game-capture-hd60-s-plus) can
be used like the Cam Link 4K. This device retails for 199\$ and is a more
reasonable purchase than an overpriced Cam Link 4K.

For the time being, I am using my iPhone because I have no space to place a
better camera a few feet in front of me. When that changes, I would look into a
[Canon m200](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/mirrorless/eos-m200-ef-m-15-45mm-is-stm-kit).

I tried the [GoPro Hero5](https://gopro.com/en/us/update/hero5), which gets
praises to be used as Webcam, but in my model the battery got very hot when
powering it with USB-C. This is why I returned it.

## Microphone

To capture audio from a professional microphone you need a FocusRite preamp,
which feeds your audio to your Mac.
