## Software

For screencasts: [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/). For live
streaming: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or
[Ecamm Live](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/).

## Camera

Everyone recommends
[Elgato Cam Link 4K](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link-4k), which
normally costs around 130\$. This helps you get a clean HDMI stream from a
supported camera:

- A GoPro Hero5 retails for 149\$. There is a chance that audio and video will
  not line up perfectly. Can be powered by USB.
- On the higher end a Canon m200 retails for 500\$. Back screen can fold up. For
  high end video.

## Microphone

To capture audio from a professional microphone you need a FocusRite preamp,
which feeds your audio to your Mac.
