The posts I write are high quality, but they take me forwever to write and
polish. I need to figure out a way to reduce the scope of a typical post to
reduce the time from inception to publish.

To my credit: my posts are usually about things that I learned only recently and
that I am still learning while writing. This is one reason why they take me so
long.

My latest 2 posts were over 1000 words (Yarn 1: 1400, GitHub Codespaces: 1200),
which is not excessively long and far from a 5000 words long piece.
