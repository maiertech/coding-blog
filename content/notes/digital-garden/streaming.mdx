## Software and cloud services

- De facto standard: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (open source). My first
  impression was: too complex, I don't have the time for such a steep learning
  curve.
- [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) is OBS without the pain.
- [Ecamm Live](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/ecammlive/) seems a very polished
  option for live streaming. If you are serious about streaming regularly, the
  monthly subscription fee is probably worth paying for less hassle.
- [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) is another solutions that is supposed to
  make it easy to get up and running.
