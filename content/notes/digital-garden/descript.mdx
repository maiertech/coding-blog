In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mANjf1Lr3jc) Chris Sevilleja
convinced me to look into Descript first before investing any time into
ScreenFlow. The first impression did not disappoint and Descript really seems
lower the barrier of entry for screencast production and editing.

## Modes

- **Edit Media:** Edit the audio/video by editing text. You can overdub in this
