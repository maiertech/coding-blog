I am currently testing [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) as an alternative
to [Screenflow](/notes/digital-garden/screenflow/). In
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mANjf1Lr3jc) Chris Sevilleja makes
a strong case for Descript. My preliminary conclusion is that the transcription
feature is great, but video recording and editing are not yet able to compete
with ScreenFlow.

## Recording

Descript comes with a screen recorder included. But I ran into two issues with
it:

1. There is no way to select a portion of the screen for recording other than
   selecting an area manually. I want to record a 16:9 portion of the screen.
   But I want to define the area for recording prior to recording. Someone on
   Discord recommended recording the full screen and then cropping it. The
   problem is that you can't crop the recording because it's not supported yet.
   But you can change its dimensions to the desired format and then scale it out
   to match the available space. You have to do that before you start splitting
   the tracks.
1. On a Retina Mac, Descript records at the effective resolution and not at the
   physical resolution (twice the effective resolution). Screenflow does this
   automatically. As nice as Descript's video editing features are, they happen
   on a low quality video. This also impacts the exported video which looks
   pretty poor on a Retina display.

## Editing

There are two modes:

- **Edit Media:** Edit the audio/video by editing text. You can overdub in this
  mode.
- **Correct text:** Fix transcription errors without affecting the audio/video.

## Keyboard shortcuts
