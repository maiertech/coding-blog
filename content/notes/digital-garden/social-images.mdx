## Step 1

Read up on the basics:

- [Everything you ever wanted to know about unfurling](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254)
- [Custom social card image services](https://notebook.lachlanjc.me/2019-11-05_custom_social_card_services/)
- [SEO Images with Unsplash](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/seo-images-with-unsplash)
- [JSX to PNG](https://components.ai/changelog/jsx-to-png)
- [Open Graph Image as a Service](https://github.com/vercel/og-image)

## Step 2

Read
[Social sharing cards with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/seo-and-social-sharing-cards-tutorial/)
from the Gatsby docs.

Wes Bos generates his open graph images with Netlify functions:

```html
<meta
  property="og:image"
  content="https://wesbos.com/.netlify/functions/ogimage?title=Parity+Purchasing+Power&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwesbos.com%2Fparity-purchasing-power"
  data-react-helmet="true"
/>
```

No images are generated during the Gatsby build, only the URL to retrieve the
image from a serverless function.

Many others like Lee Rob add an open graph image to the GitHub repo and link it
directly.

Gatsby uses one hard wired image for all blog posts. This could be the fatest
way to get this off teh ground.

Swyx uses an image from the post and if there are no images, a default image.
