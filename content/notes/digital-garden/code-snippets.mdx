## Carbon

[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) is the standard for creating images of source
code. Never ever use this for any code that contains anything confidential. The
moment you hit the Tweet button, a screenshot of your code is
[published on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carbon_noreply).

Use [carbon-now-cli](https://github.com/mixn/carbon-now-cli/) to create images
of code from your CLI.
