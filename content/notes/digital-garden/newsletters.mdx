While [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) is not impartial it features a
great comparison with its competitors in the footer of its homepage.

## ConvertKit

[ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) is the gold standard for creators. It can
also do paid newsletters and automations, e.g. onboarding. You can start for
free with up to 1000 subscribers. But it does get expensive fast. Maintaining a
big mailing list is costly.

| Subscribers | Price per month |
| :---------- | :-------------- |
| 5,000       | 79$             |
| 10,000      | 119$            |
| 25,000      | 199$            |

ConvertKit does not support authoring in Markdown. You can work around by using
an editor that can produce raw HTML from a Markdown file.

## Buttondown

[Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) seems the be the only solution out there
that supports composing emails in Markdown. This means that you can author your
newsletter in your GitHub repo as MDX and then cross-post to Buttondown.

Buttondown supports only one newsletter per account. You can add a second
newsletter created in second Buttondown account using the second account's API
key. It's not clear whether the second account can be deleted after that.

Pricing is also not cheap, but the curve is flatter than ConvertKit. 29$ for pro
and then 5$ per 1000 subscribers:

| Subscribers | Price per month |
| :---------- | :-------------- |
| 5,000       | 54$             |
| 10,000      | 79$             |
| 25,000      | 154$            |

## Ghost

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blocks access to their site from my VPN provider and
unfortunately, they are not inclined to change that. That's a deal breaker.
