Hi, I'm <span title="pronounced as tee-lo">Thilo</span>, a web developer based
in Queens, NY. Welcome to my digital garden on web development. The term digital
garden was coined by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/) in his post
[Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/).
As [Chris Biscardi](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/) writes in
[What is a Digital Garden?](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/), "It's writing
without worrying about what people will think. It's writing in small, unfinished
pieces and building them up to larger more edited pieces, in public."

Writing without worrying what people will think is a big step for me. I have
always wanted to share my thoughts and my work in public,
[making the switch from consumer to creator](https://nathanbarry.com/consumer-to-creator/),
but I never dared to start the journey.

With my digital garden on web development I am trying to capture the many small
learnings and insights I have during my everyday work as a web developer. I
capture them as [Notes](/notes/). Initially, notes are unrefined, sometimes even
inaccurate. I iterate and refine them as I learn more and have new insights. But
I might also scrap a note when it gets stale or is not relevant to me any
longer. That's why links to my notes should not be considered permanent.

Eventually, my notes mature and then it's time to compile one or more notes into
a post. [Posts](/posts/) are more refined and edited and probably tweetworthy.
That's why they get a publication date and a permanent link. But that does not
mean that they are like printed articles. They can still get updates or edits.
