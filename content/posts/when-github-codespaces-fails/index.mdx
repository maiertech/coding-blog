title: What to do when GitHub Codespaces fails?

  GitHub Codespaces has turned out to be very reliable during the beta. I have
  moved most of my day-to-day development over to Codespaces. A few times I ran
  into a situation where Codespaces had an outage or some other problem that
  made it temporarily unusable. In this post I am sharing my lessons learned of
  what to do when Codespaces fails.

In my post
[Introduction to GitHub Codespaces](/posts/introduction-to-github-codespaces/) I
described the benefits of developing with
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) as an alternative to
local development on a computer. As I mentioned in that post, I had occasional
issues with Codespaces and was unable to develop with them for a few hours or in
one instance for an entire weekend. As frustrating as this may be, it is
expected for a service that has a beta label. But as a prudent developer, you
should hedge against this scenario to avoid that you cannot work for a longer
period of time.

## Codespaces Beta community

The first thing you should do when you notice an issue with Codespaces is visit
the
[Codespaces Beta community](https://github.community/c/code-to-cloud/codespaces-beta/45)
to see if there are any known issues with Codespaces that have been brought up
by the community. If this is not the case, you should consider posting a message
and describe your issue. There a few members of the Codespaces team in this
community and while you should not expect real time support, they usually
respond very quickly. It should be obvious, but the chances of your issue
getting fixed fast are much higher when the Codespaces team is aware of it.

Here are some of the issues I had with GitHub Codespaces. The Codespaces team
did a fantastic job to respond to every single issue very quickly:

- [Yarn installation fails](https://github.community/t/yarn-installation-fails/159455)
- [Extensions defined in devcontainer.json are not installed](https://github.community/t/extensions-defined-in-devcontainer-json-are-not-installed/156489)
- [Missing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension](https://github.community/t/missing-github-pull-requests-and-issues-extension/144631)
- [Sluggish performance](https://github.community/t/sluggish-performance/142535)
- [Codespace terminal gets launched in wrong directory](https://github.community/t/codespace-terminal-gets-launched-in-wrong-directory/143788)
- [postCreateCommand does not run](https://github.community/t/postcreatecommand-does-not-run/142677)

## Docker Desktop to the rescue?

If your issue is a blocker and you cannot wait for it to be fixed, it is time
for plan B. As discussed in my introductory post mentioned above, you can run a
Codespaces config with Docker. For this to work, you need to install two VS code
extensions. I wrote a chunk about each extension to explain their config:

- [Docker extension](/chunks/vs-code-docker-extension/)
- [Remote - Containers extension](/chunks/vs-code-remote-containers-extension/)

This allows you to spin up a development container from VS Code's remote
explorer with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
and clone a GitHub repository inside. You should be up and running in a few
minutes. The only problem: running Docker Desktop on my 2019 Macbook Air with 16
GB RAM is quite ambitious and results in a slow and sluggish development
experience.

## Homebrew to the rescue!

- How I use my dotfiles repo to install my dev environment on the Mac
- How it is different when compared to container definitions
- Why this fall back makes sense.
